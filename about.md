![At a fruit market](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/about/fruitmarket.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I [help](https://mixpanel.com/) the world understand its data.

Before that, I used [formal](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3035926) 
[techniques](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2790516) 
to prove that software systems are secure under certain assumptions.
I also helped teach [two](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/items/18631.html) 
[classes](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece734/),

And before _that_, 
I helped fuel the growth of two edtech companies at the same time.
[One of them](https://edfinity.com/) provided hard math questions 
for teachers to assign to their students,
and [the other](https://www.yup.com/) 
matched students to tutors when they had trouble with their homework.

Fun facts: 
1. I'm from a [place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore) 
	known internationally for its [strict laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum_ban_in_Singapore),
	but I'm much more bothered by it having only two seasons: hot and hotter.
2. My mother's maiden name is "Na". Once when filling out parental information 
    on a form, I was chided for stating that her maiden name was _Not Applicable_.
3. It took me _six_ tries in three different states and 
	two different countries to get a driver's license. 
	Despite that, two of my friends still wanted me to teach them to drive,
	and they both got their licences within two attempts.
