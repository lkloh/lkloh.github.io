![At a fruit market](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/about/fruitmarket.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I [help](https://mixpanel.com/) the world understand its data.

Before that, I used [formal](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3035926) 
[techniques](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2790516) to prove that software systems are secure 
certain assumptions. In theory, of course.
I also helped teach [two](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/items/18631.html) 
[classes](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece734/),

And before _that_, 
I helped fuel the growth of two ed-tech companies at the same time.
[One of them](https://edfinity.com/) provided hard math questions 
for teachers to assign to their students,
and [the other](https://www.yup.com/) 
matched students with tutors when they had trouble with their homework.

I was warned about culture shock when I moved countries to attend
[college](https://www.stanford.edu/),
but it turns out that people tend to be the same everywhere.

Fun facts: 
1. My mother's maiden name is "Na". Once when filling out parental information 
    on a form, I was chided for stating that her maiden name was _Not Applicable_.
2. It took me _six_ tries in three different states and 
	two different countries to get a driver's license.
3. Despite (2), two of my friends still wanted me to teach them to drive,
	and they both got their licences within two attempts.
