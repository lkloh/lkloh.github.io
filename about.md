![At a fruit market](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/about/fruitmarket.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm a [software engineer](https://mixpanel.com/) in San Francisco,
helping the world understand its data.

Before that, I was in [grad school](http://www.cmu.edu/), 
where I used formal techniques to prove that software systems are secure under 
a particular set of idealized, usually short-lived assumptions.
You can read more [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3035926) 
and [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2790516).
I also served as a teaching assistant for [two](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/courses/items/18631.html) 
[classes](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece734/),

And before grad school, I helped fuel the growth of two ed-tech companies at the same time.
[One of them](https://edfinity.com/) provided hard math questions for teachers to assign to their students,
and [the other](https://www.yup.com/) 
matched students with tutors when they had trouble with their homework.

I first came to the United States from Singapore in 2010 to attend 
[college](https://www.stanford.edu/).

Fun facts: 
1. My mother's maiden name is "Na". Once when filling out parental information 
    on a form, I was chided for stating that her maiden name was *Not Applicable*.
2. It took me 6 tries in three different states and 
	two different countries to get a driver's license.
3. Despite (2), two of my friends still wanted me to teach them to drive,
	and they both got their licences within two attempts.
