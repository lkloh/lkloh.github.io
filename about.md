![At a fruit market](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/about/fruitmarket.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm a product engineer at [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/).

Before, I was a research assistant at [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/),
where one of the things I was to use formal techniques to prove that software systems are secure under 
a particular set of idealized, usually short-lived assumptions.
You can read more [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3035926) 
and [here](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2790516).
I also served as a teaching assistant for two classes,
Introduction to Information Security and [Foundations of Privacy](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece734/).
That was when I truly understood the important
of conciseness after grading the homework of 120 students. 

Between college and grad school, I was a front-end engineer at Dwellers, 
an ecommerce company that provided a recurring subscription for commonly used household groceries.
After figuring out that the ecommerce space was already overcrowded,
Dwellers became MathCrunch, 
which provides personalized mathematics tutoring to high school students. 
I also worked as a contractor for [Edfinity](https://edfinity.com/), 
which helps drives student traffic to MathCrunch by providing
challenge problems for teachers to pass on to their students. 
Sometime after I left, MathCrunch rebranded as [Yup Technologies](https://www.yup.com/),
and now offers tutoring in multiple subjects.

Previously, I studied math and computer science at Stanford University, 
where I was the treasurer for the [Singaporeans at Stanford Society](https://sas.stanford.edu/).

And before that, I attended [NUS High School](http://www.nushigh.edu.sg/), 
where I could really have used Yup if it had existed then. 

Some fun facts about me: 
1. My mother's maiden name is "Na". Once when filling out parental information 
    on a form, I was chided for stating that her maiden name was *Not Applicable*.
2. It took me 6 tries in three different states and two different countries to get a driver's license.
3. Despite (2), two of my friends still wanted me to teach them to drive,
	and I helped them get their license after only two attempts.
