  <div class="content">
    <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Wikipedia</a>: 
REST web services allow systems to access resources
using a predefined set of stateless operations.</p>

<p>Goals of REST systems</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast</li>
  <li>Reliable</li>
  <li>Decoupled system components - easier to manage</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="client-server">Client-Server</h2>

<p>Separate user interface / data storage.</p>

<p>Advantage: components to be managed/updated independently 
	- easier to manage and update them separately</p>

<h2 id="stateless-communication">Stateless communication</h2>

<p>Every request from the client to the server must contain
all the necessary information.
The server cannot store anything.
Only the client is allowed to store any information.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to recover from failures.</li>
  <li>Server’s job is simple =&gt; easy to scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Repetitive data sent to server</li>
  <li>More network overhead due to repetitive data being sent</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cache">Cache</h2>

<p>Data in a response to a request must be labeled as cacheable/non-cacheable.</p>

<p>If cacheable: client cache may reuse that response data for later request.</p>

<p>Advantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Disavantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Less reliable due to stale data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="uniform-interface-between-components">Uniform Interface between components</h2>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplified system architecture</li>
  <li>Easy to update implementation, which is independent from service provided</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Less efficient - cannot optimize information transferred for specific use cases</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="layered-system">Layered system</h2>

<p>Components cannot see beyond their immediate layer.</p>

<p>Advantage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>System is more simple</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvange:</p>
<ul>
  <li>More overhead when processing data (but caching can help)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lazily-add-features">Lazily add features</h2>

<p>(Optional)</p>

<p>To minimized mandatory features that must be implemented,
allow functionality to be extended by additional scripts when necessary.</p>

This helps avoid the ‘works on my machine’ problem.</p>

<p>Yarn needs to know which version you developed on

<p>The yarn.lock file is automatically generated

<p>Example <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/43621/what-if-i-accidentally-run-command-chmod-r-on-system-directories-etc">here</a>:
someone ran <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo chmod 755 -R /</code> and started getting permissions issues on everything.

    <p>Two separate interviewers tried to give me this same question.
I answered it correctly at the phone screen, 
and told the interviewer at the onsite that I had already seen this question.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Find</span> <span class="n">out</span> <span class="n">whether</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">matrix</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">Toeplitz</span> <span class="n">Matrix</span><span class="o">.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a> 
has the same integers on all of its diagonals.
It can be of any dimension, not necessarily square.
For example,</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>is a Toeplitz matrix, but</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>is not a Toeplitz matrix.</p>

<p>Let’s gain an insight by looking at the example of a Toeplitz matrix above.
Notice that when displacing the rows, we get a pattern:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>      <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
   <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It seems that for any row <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> and row <code class="highlighter-rouge">i+1</code> in a Toeplitz matrix with <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> rows and <code class="highlighter-rouge">m</code> columns
shifting row <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> by one position would result in
elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">0, 1, ..., m-2</code> of row <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> being the same
as elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">1, ..., m-1</code> of row <code class="highlighter-rouge">i+1</code>.</p>

<p>However, in the non-Toeplitz matrix, this is not the case.</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>      <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
   <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Thus we want something like:</p>
<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_toeplitz_matrix</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">):</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">nrows</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">ncols</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">centers_align</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ncols</span><span class="p">):</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">centers_align</code> checks whether two adjacent rows could be rows of a Toeplitz matrix.</p>

<p>To check if two adjacent rows are rows of a Toeplitz matrix:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">centers_align</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">next_row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ncols</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">array_equal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:(</span><span class="n">ncols</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)],</span> <span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">next_row</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="ss">:ncols</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Putting them together, we get the solution.
We have to examine almost all the numbers in each row, so this is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(nm)</code> solution in time.
Depending on implementation, the space could be constant if you
passed the rows of the matrix to <code class="highlighter-rouge">centers_align</code> by reference.</p>

<p>To scale the solution when given a very large matrix, one way is to
break up the matrix into several contiguous blocks,
then check each block on a different machine.
If any of the blocks was not a Toeplitz, then the matrix is not a Toeplitz matrix.
If each block was also a Toeplitz matrix,
then we could check if putting them together would make a toeplitz matrix. 
then merge them together.
Assuming we broke the matrix into <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> blocks,
that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">n / b</code> matrices to check on each machine,
so <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(nm / b)</code> time to check the blocks separately.
To merge them, we have to merge <code class="highlighter-rouge">n / b</code> blocks,
so its <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(nm / b)</code> time to merge.
So you could check this in <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(nm / b)</code> time
and get time savings depending on what <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> is.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2017/07/02/median-of-a-long-running-stream.html">Median of a long running stream</a></h1>

  <div class="content">
    <p>“What is the best way find the approximate median of a huge stream of numbers,
so large that they can’t all fit into memory at the same time?”</p>

<p>The smart way to do this when the stream can fit into memory, is to
use a max heap and a min heap. 
That would give an efficient answer in <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n log n)</code> time and <code class="highlighter-rouge">O(n)</code> space.
But now there’s not enough space.</p>

<p>The answer to this needs you to remember that computers have a maximum 
number of digits they can represent.
Lets say 4 bytes to a number, meaning that numbers must fit within 32 bits. 
So the integers can only range from -2^31 to 2^31-1,
a.k.a. -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647.
So that’s a maximum of <code class="highlighter-rouge">2^32</code> possible digits.
Given that 2^10 = 1024 ~ 1000 = 1kb, therefore (2^10) * (2^10) * (2^10) * 4
would only be 4000kb, a.k.a. 4MB, which would fit into memory.</p>

<p>So the right way to do things is to keep track of the number of times
every possible integer in the stream was seen,
and also the number of integers seen so far.
Then when someone queries for the median, it would be fairly easy to 
compute the median in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The last post I wrote was about using <a href="https://pramp.com/#/">Pramp</a> 
to prepare for technical interviews
with other people who are also doing the same.</p>

<p>Pramp was awesome for preparation of course, 
because I could schedule interviews every two hours. 
Only sad thing was the interviews could only be scheduled between 11am - 11pm
(I was on the East Coast in Pittsburgh),
in other to ensure that I had a peer to be matched too.
It’s likely because most of the users are in California,
where the headquarters of many tech companies are. 
While I did get one onsite interview with a hiring manager from Amazon,
it’s not built specifically for the purpose of matching users
to places they may be interested in working at.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about <a href="https://interviewing.io/">interviewing.io</a>,
which matches people preparing for technical interviews,
to experienced engineers to give them proper feedback. 
Both parties are anonymous during the interview session
to remove as much unconscious bias as possible.
After the interview, if both parties want to unmask their identities,
they can do so. 
If you do well, you might get invited to onsite interviews
at the places where those engineers work.</p>

<p>I tried siging up for it while job hunting, 
but got an automated message stating that they were still in beta
and that I would be up later.
So I emailed <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello@interviewing.io</code>, 
and one of the cofounders got back to me and let me onto the platform immediately.
It seems that for small startups of &lt;10 people,
the cofounders themselves are often monitoring the emails coming in from users,
so asking for something might actually be pretty effective.</p>

<p>Well, I tried to book a slot, but the earliest one was a week later.
So I continued practising with Pramp until then.
The first interviewer gave me a pretty tough problem 
(that could be solved using a graph traversal algorithm)
that was a scaled up version of one of the problems I got on Pramp,
and I took almost 90 min (a.k.a. double the time of a regular 45 min long interview session)
to solve it. Even then, I’m not sure if I got a complete working solution,
but the interviewer was sufficiently impressed to ask to be introduced to me.</p>

<p>I had to wait another week to book the next interview.
I got a generic dynamic programming question at that one,
which I should have known how to solve immediately, but didn’t.</p>

<p>So I had to wait another week to book another interview.
I was getting annoyed at this point,
because the site said that it was meant to help people practice their
technical interviewing skills,
but waiting a week between each practice isn’t very helpful.
At the third interview, I got a pretty simple question that was
a scaled down version of a real world problem</p>
<ul>
  <li>how would one generate a unique id for each additional machine added to a data center
in a scalable way?</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps I practised technical interviews a bit too much.
For that question, I stated the obvious:
to have a global counter tracking the highest numerical id
of all the machines in the data center.
When a new machine is added, increment the global counter by 1
and set that to be the unique id of the new machine. 
I figured we wouldn’t run into integer overflow problems
on a modern 64-bit machine because data centers are not that large right now.</p>

<p>I should have stopped there.
But instead I tried to be smart and talk about further ways of optimization,
because the problem reminded me of some hacky technical challenge problem
I had seen in the past.
The interviewer actually didn’t like that,
because he advised me to focus on demonstrating real life engineering skills
instead of trying to impress people with how clever I was theoretically. 
He even said he could tell that I was in “interviewing mode” then,
and advised me to try and act more like a genuine human instead of some
algorithm solving machine.</p>

<p>I’m guessing he works for a relatively small start-up.
At most bigger companies, being in “interviewing mode”
is exactly what you want to be at to get the job. 
Because these places have the resources to train you from scratch
and just care that you know the fundamentals well.</p>

<p>At smaller start-ups I interview at, 
I got a lot more focus on real skills that I would be 
expected to apply if I actually got the job and started working there.
Things like system design, or code refactoring,
or HTML/JavaScript specific exercises.</p>

<p>It’s hard to remain in interview mode for long once you have a job,
because the types of traditional algorithm challenges given out at
large companies tend to be far removed from what a software engineer really does.
Soon after accepting an offer, 
I scheduled another practice at interviewing.io just to see how I would do.
The interviewer told me I “needed more practice”.</p>
