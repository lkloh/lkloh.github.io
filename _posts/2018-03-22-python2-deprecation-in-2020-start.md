title: Python 2 will stop being updated after Jan 1, 2020

Apparently Guido is going to stop updating Python 2 after
the start of 2020, not even adding security patches,
according to [this email](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html).

Migration to Python 3 will take a long time.
Instagram took about [10 months](https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/).
The biggest reason they gave for their success was because they did it in small iterations,
never any major changes.
