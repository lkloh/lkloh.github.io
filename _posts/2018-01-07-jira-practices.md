[Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-jira-core/get-started-with-jira-core-cloud-917965360.html)
is sometimes used by project managers to plan a feature release.

* Task - work to be done, typically completed in less than a week. Status can be "Not started/ Work in progress/ Reviewable/ Completed".
* Sprints - time in which work is done
* Epic - a special kind of task, used to track and plan a for large piece of work that may take several weeks to finish. You can link subtasks to an epic. 
* Backlog - work that is nice to have but not critically to complete immediately is marked as part of the backlog.

Once a feature is released, its tracking Epic is marked as "Complete".
Small bugs related to that feature are still marked as part of the Epic
but go into the backlog, where they are only picked up again
if there is a clear need for it to enhance user happiness.
