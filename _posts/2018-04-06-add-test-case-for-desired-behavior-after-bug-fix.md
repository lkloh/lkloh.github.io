title: "Add a test case for desired behavior after a bug has been fixed"

If you've fixed the root cause for a bug that has been reported...
hopefully by someone doing QA,
likely by a customer...
best practice is to add a unit test verifying that the expected behavior occurs.

Oh and of course take a close look before and after deploying.
