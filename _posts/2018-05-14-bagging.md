Summarized from [here](http://enhancedatascience.com/2017/06/28/machine-learning-explained-bagging/).

## What it does

Use to improve performance of simple models and reduce overfitting of complex models.

## How it works

Uses averaging of several models.

## Bagged trees example

To get 100 models to average.

For each iteration 1...100:
* Take a sample with replacement of original dataset
* Train a regression tree on the sample
* Save the model

Now to predict using the bagged model on new data:
* Use the 1...100 trees trained earlier to make a prediction
* Average the predictions

## Pros

Model is more robust (filter out effects of noise)

## Cons

Harder to explain how a prediction was made and the factors contributing to it.
