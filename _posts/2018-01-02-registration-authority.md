When an internet domain owner wants to host a website,
it needs to get an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority
to allow the use of HTTPS so that users can feel secure when using their website.

The Certificate Authority of course issues or revokes SSL certificates.

But since the entire ecosystem is so complex npw, the Registration Authority (RA)
is needed to participate with the Certificate Authority to perform additional
management task of domain owners requesting a certificate,
such as validating their claim that they are a legitimate business
that would be a good Internet citizen.
After the domain owner gets a certificate, the RA may monitor them
to ensure they continue to be good actors.
