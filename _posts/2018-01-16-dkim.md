Summarized from [here](https://blog.returnpath.com/how-to-explain-dkim-in-plain-english-2/).

## What is it

Email authenticateion protocol, known to be complicated.

## What it is used for

Lets an organization send a message that can be verificed by mailbox providers

## How the verification is done

Cryptographic authentication


# How it works

## Identify elements of the message to sign

Choices to choose from
* Entire message
* Some fields in the header

What to think about
* The elements that are signed cannot be changed in transit, 
or the authentication will fail

## How the elements of the message are signed

1. Sender's email platform creates a hash of the elements to be signed.
2. The hash is encrypted with the sender's private key.
3. Email is sent

## Validation by the email provider that receives the email

1. Realizes the email received has a DKIM signature
2. Finds the domain/selector that signed it
3. Does the DNS query for the domain/selector's public key
4. Used the public key to decrypt the DKIM signature to the original hash
5. Generates its own has of the elements
6. Compares the hashes to ensure they match


# Why DKIM is used despite being complex

To limit spam.

# Why its not being as widely used as it should be

Complicated implementation.
