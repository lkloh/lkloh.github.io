To see what network requests are made,
go to the Chrome DevTools Network panel and look at the requests there. 
You'll want to view "all" requests being made in order to inspect the headers.

If you're using this because you're testing/developing something,
remember to "disable cache"! 
Otherwise you may get unexpected results.
