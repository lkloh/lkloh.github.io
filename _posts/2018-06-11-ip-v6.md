Summarized from [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/index.html).

## Why IPv6

Any internet-connected device needs a unique number "IP Address" to connect to the Internet,
just like how a phone needs a phone number system to make a call.

The current internet address sytem is IPv4, and only allows for about 4 billion addresses,
not enough for everyone in the world.
And most people in developed countries have multiple internet-connected devices.
Clearly, more IP addresses are needed.

IPv6 allows for `3.4 x 10^38` IP addresses,
giving the internet almost infinite room to grow for the forseeable future.


## Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6

World IPv6 launch on June 6, 2012 - 
rollout for major website and ISP, and equipment makers.

The transition will last for a while as every website and ISP must make the switch.
Right now IPv4 and IPv6 are both supported,
but chances are IPv4 will be forcefully deprecated in a few years time.


## Getting IPv6

* Your device must support it
* The website visiting must support it
* And your ISP must enable it
