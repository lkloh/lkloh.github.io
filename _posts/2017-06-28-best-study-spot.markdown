![The best study spot](https://{{ site.url }}/assets/2017/June/28/overview.JPG){:class="img-responsive"}

Its not on [this helpful list](http://library.stanford.edu/using/study) provided by Stanford!
Most of them are libraries, 
so they are too quiet, and you can't eat or drink anything.

Recently, I went back to Stanford to visit a friend. Before meeting up,
I decided to revisit my favorite study spot on campus.
It's on the third floor of the 
[English Department](https://english.stanford.edu/about/contact-and-location),
quiet, peaceful, nice surroundings, 
plenty of tables to choose from. 
There's even a vending machine really close by if you get hungry,
and I spent way more money at it than I should have.
