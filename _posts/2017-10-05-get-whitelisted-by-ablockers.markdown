Some adblockers whitelist trackers if they comply with Do Not Track (DNT)
[completely](https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy).
A DNT user does not want a domain he visits to know/remember anything about him.

Or pay [AdBlock Plus](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play/) to whitelist you.
You'll probably have to 
[comply](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#application)
with certain policies.
