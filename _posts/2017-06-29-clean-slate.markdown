When you work with software, you may end up [installing a lot of packages](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558). 
After a while your computer starts behaving really sluggishly. 
Also, it’s really hard to erase some software packages completely from your hard drive.
`brew uninstall <clingy-package>` alone won't cut it. 
You'll have to really dig into your system to search for everywhere the 
package could have been installed to as a back up.  
So, that means a scorched earth solution is just a lot easier.
 
Thus every 6 months, I end up reinstalling the OS on my MacBookPro. 
Apple makes it really easy to wipe my hard drive and reinstall the OS. 
Just boot in recovery mode, erase the disk, sign in with your apple id, 
and agree to all the licenses without reading them. 
Assuming a decent internet connection, this may take just under an hour. 
 
I usually back up all my work on Github and BitBucket, 
so unless there is something critical that I’m working on now 
(but I usually make sure that’s not the case before reinstalling the OS), 
I don’t need to do anything else. 
 
Now to reinstalling everything I need for your my environment. Xcode, LaTeX, Github, Sublime Text are some of the must haves. There are cloud-based frameworks that abstract away the annoying installations for many of these, but it’s hard to get serious work done with them. 
Of course, it means I'll have to 
generate a add a new ssh key to 
[Github](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
 and [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html). 
 
Eventually I’ll repeat this after another 6 months.
