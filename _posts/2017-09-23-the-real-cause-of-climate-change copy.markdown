They don't make them like they used to... 

Or so grandpa complains.

Maybe he's just being a grumpy old man.
Or maybe he's right.

My grandparents have a fan they bought when my mother was 6 years old.
They used it all the time at home, before lending it to my aunt when she headed off to college.
She returned it when she was done, since it was still working.
My grandfather decided to being it to his shop, 
where he turned it on whenever he was there, at least 40 hours a week.

They've had it for over 50 years now and it's still going strong.
Sure he has to wipe it down and oil it every few years,
but that's all the maintainence he's had to make it
last for over _half a century_!

Of course, new fans break down a lot faster. 
You'll be lucky if they last 5 years.
They're made to break down after a set period on purpose
so that manufacturers can turn a profit.
If everything they made lasted 50 years,
they'll be bankrupt very soon.

And not just fans, of course.
All other electronic equipment.
My mother's kettle, bought before she married my father,
lasted through 20 years of daily usage.
My electric water boiler barely lasted me through college.  

When such things break down, they tend to end up in a landfill.
And they typically aren't biogradable.
Imagine this compounded by every person/household.
Now you see why everyone's carbon footprint is getting larger and larger.

Perhaps building a reliable product that can last 50 years,
but requiring customers to "pay" to extend its life every 5 years or so 
would be an environmentally-friendly compromise?
