title: "Theranos and only investing in things you understand"

So by now the truth about Theranos is out, and it's a fraud.
It's technology didn't work properly,
but instead of closing the company down when they figured out that the 
technology didn't work, the leaders instead chose to conceal things
and sue employees who raised concerns.

The board of director's was composed of very senior people in high positions,
but almost none of them had relevant experience to oversee a company
specializing in medical technology.
The company refused to be open about how their technology worked,
citing fears of competitors stealing their ideas instead
of publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals 
to obtain ideas for improvement from qualified professionals.

Lesson learnt: never be associated with or invest in a company 
(no matter how talented they are at marketing) unless you
understand the field well - first said by Warren Buffett.
If you work for such a company and you get shut down if genuine concerns 
you raise are ignored - 
If you can afford the [legal costs of being sued](https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-whistleblower-shook-the-companyand-his-family-1479335963), file a complain
with regulators to protect customers and investors and quit.
If you can't afford it, find a new job and quit while you still have a job
- the [layoffs](https://gizmodo.com/theranos-is-getting-rid-of-nearly-half-of-its-staff-1790903989) are coming one way or another so better to jump ship before everyone knows
you work at a place with bad practices.
