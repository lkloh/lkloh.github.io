Firefox is going to [block tracking by default](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/) for the following reasons:
* Loss of privacy due to targeted advertising - 
  In the physical world, if you buy something from Target
  and then head to Walmart, no one from Target is going to follow you into Walmart as well.
  But this is exactly what happens on the internet, so Firefox is going stop this stalking by
  blocking third-party cookies.
* Reduced page load performance - extra tracking scripts slow down page load time.
