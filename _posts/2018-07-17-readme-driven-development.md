[This article](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
discusses writing a readme before any code, or tests, or professional documentation.
It forces you to think about how what you want to code up and write it down,
but with just enough detail to outline things.
Watefull design (specifying every tiny thing to build) isn't ideal either
as being too detailed about something that hasn't been built yet is a waste of effort
as things will almost _definitely_ get altered during the actual implementation.

Writing the readme is a good middle group between too much specifications and
no specifications, by avoiding too much detail
but also nudging you to keep things small and modularized.
It's also useful to communicate what you're building to someone else,
and helps motivate you to document things _while_ they are being implemented
and you have the most context, not after shipping.
