[Spam traps](https://help.campaignmonitor.com/spam-trap-email-addresses) 
are used to build [blacklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpamCop) 
of known or suspected spammers.
Suspected spammers are commonly identified by:

## Putting fake email address on the internet

Literally email addresses that belong to no once,
created for the sole purpose of catching spammers.

Anyone who harvests email addresses on the internet
who finds one of these and sends email to them
will be blacklisted. 

## Using inactive email accounts as bait

Email accounts that have not been used for a long time are
sometime reused as bait as well.
Example: using `ireallylovebackstreetboz1987@aol.com` 
which you made in elementary school and abandoned when you
decided to use a more professional sounding email
after you grew up a bit.

This means that legitimate mail list owners that don't
regularly reconfirm their mailing list to get 
people on their list to re-confirm that they want to receive messages,
could get blacklisted. 

## Typos that turn out to be a spam trap address

If `jame@gmail.com` is a fake email address put out 
for the purpose of identifying spammers, 
and the user with email `jane@gmail.com` makes a typo
when submitting her address to a mailing list and
enters `jame@gmail.com`, this may cause your IP to be flagged
as a suspected spammer.

# Avoiding being labelled as a spammer

Regularly (e.g. every 3 months or so)
reconfirm your mailing list by getting subscribers
to confirm they are still interested in receiving mail from you.

If an email bounces once, remove it from the database
of emails you send messages to.
It could be a fake email address,
or belong to an inactive account that will eventually be re-used as 
a spam trap.

Troublesome though. I don't actually remember ever
getting any form of notification from any mailing list 
to re-confirm I wanted to opt in.
