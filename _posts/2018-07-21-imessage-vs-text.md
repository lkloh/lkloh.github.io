If you have an iPhone, you might notice that your text messages to Alice
and blue, while text messages to Bob are green.
Though I didn't really notice until someone pointed it out to me,
the difference between the blue and green is so innocuous that I never cared to figure out why.

Apparently [blue chat messages are sent using iMessage](https://www.payetteforward.com/difference-between-imessage-text-messages-iphone/),
while green chat messages are sent using the regular SMS service.
Apple tries to use iMessage to send texts between two users when possible,
assuming they are both connected to wifi and have iPhones.
Otherwise, if one or both users are not connected to wifi/ don't use iPhone,
the it sends the message using the regular SMS.

iMessage is superior as it can send more infomation than SMS can,
such as photos/videos/files, and emojis. 
Drawback if that if you use a phone plan that charges for data usage, 
that can cause some nasty surprises if you regularly send large files.
My phone plan is fixed cost and throttles based on usage, so I didn't notice
anything for months.
But if you do get charged based on usage, best to disable cellular data for iMessage
unless you really need it.
