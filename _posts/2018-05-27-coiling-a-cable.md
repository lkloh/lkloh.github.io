To coil an electric cable,
you can't just coil it continuously in the same direction like you might for yarn.
It's stiff and coiling in one direction would cause the cable to have all kinds of kinks in it
that are very hard to get out.

Instead, you must coil it first in one direction (over loop) and then the reverse direction (under loop).
Then if its a long cable, tie it together after coiling.
This helps avoid messes.
