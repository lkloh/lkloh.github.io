When shooting a video with a camera, look out for these in order or priority

* Framing (make sure the people being recorded is captured)
* Focus
* Brightness

Framing and focus are the most important as if they are off,
the data for that cannot be retrieved.

Brightness is fixable in post production,
so only adjust brightness AFTER framing, then focus
are taken care off.

Also, be careful of jerking the camera too much.
There is no need to track people on stage too carefully as long as they are
mostly centered in the camera, not _perfectly_ centered.
Tracking the people on stage too carefully leads to jerkiness of the camera
as you inevitably alter the settings and shift things around.

Best not to talk during shooting either as it disrupts the audience;
the director would repeat instructions if they are not being following
because you were busying doing something else/ didn't hear correctly the first time.
