Don't deploy on a Friday.

Or to be more specific, do not deploy feature update on Friday.
"Get of out trouble" fixes are acceptable deploys on Friday.
Non time sensitive updates are not.

Several people I know (especially myself) had to be burnt by this before
learning not to deploy non-urgent changes on Friday.

Otherwise you run the risk of something going wrong at 7am on Monday when your customers
start using your product again.
You get into the office at 9am and someone reports a complaint at 11am.
Now you have not touched the code for >48 hours and there is a cache-miss in your brain
when you think about what likely caused the complaint, and take longer to fix things.
In the meantime, customers get angrier, and you get angrier that this is waiting
for you on Monday.
