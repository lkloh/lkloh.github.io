[Dark Traffic](https://beymour.com/dark-traffic) 
is when a user visits a site through a particular referral
(e.g. Facebook link),
but a site analytics tool (e.g. Google Analytics)
wrongly attributed to some other method 
(e.g. typed it directly into the browser).

Usually if analytics tools can't tell how a user ended up on a webpage,
it classifics it as direct traffic (typed the URL right into the browser).
Obviously bad for advertisers and people in charge of branding as they don't
have the right data to make decisions about how to improve visibility.

It's an increasing problem because of mobile browsers/ IOT/ Amazon echo
more ways to visit a website and view its content than
just using a desktop browser.
