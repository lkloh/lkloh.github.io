title: "Parsing strings to numbers in C++ in different bases"
---

Summarized from [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol).

Suppose I have a vector of these strings
```
vector<string> strings{"0x45", "12", "78", "0b01001", "0x78"};
```
and I wanted to parse them to numbers. Then the best thing to do is:
```c++
std::vector<int> string_to_int(std::vector<std::string>& strings) {
  std::vector<int> integers;
  for (std::string num_str : string_to_int) {
    int n = std::stoi(num_str, nullptr, 0);
    integers.push_back();
  }
}
```

since `std::stoi(num_str, nullptr, 0)` automatically determines the base of the value 
based on the prefix of `num_str`.
