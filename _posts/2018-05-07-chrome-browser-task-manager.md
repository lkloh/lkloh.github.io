I was trying to download a large amount of data from a webapp,
and it was taking forever.
I decided to kill the browser so I wouldn't be staring at an infinitely
spinning spinner.

How to kill the webapp?

## Method 1: Force quit the entire Chrome Browser

On a Mac, type `option-command-esc` to force an app 
(in this case the browser) to quit.

## Method 2: Force only the offending tab to quit

You do use tabs and not open a new browser window for each website you're looking at right?
In Chrome, go to the menu, click on `more tools`,
and then go to the `task manager`. 
You can see which tab is using the most CPU and kill just that tab.
