title:  "Where did all the good domain names go?"

I'm going to try an explain [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02767.pdf)
as intuitively as possible, in parts.
This part is on why many good domains names are taken,
and more are being bought each day.

The paper surveys the landscape of domain name typosquatting.
Before reading it, a few concepts should be made clear here.
A "domain name" is the address you type into a web browser to go to a particular website.
For example, you might type facebook.com to visit the Facebook site.
facebook.com is the domain name that Facebook, Inc owns.

Now, almost any business owner some sort of website that customers could pull up.
For example, a bakery owner needs a website to
post their menu, pictures of their food,
their location, and business hours,
so that customers can visit them when they are open.
So if your bakery is called Delicious Bakery and located in Northright, CA,
you might want your business's domain name to be 
[delicious-bakery.com](http://www.delicious-bakery.com/) - easy for customers to remember.

To own delicious-bakery.com, you'll want to
go to a domain name registrar, such as [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/),
and register yourself as the owner of that domain name.
The domain name registrar will check to make sure the that
no one owns delicious-bakery.com.
Now assuming no one does, you pay a small fee (something like USD $10),
and the domain is yours for a year.
If your bakery does well,
presumably you'll keep renewing the domain name delicious-bakery.com every year.

But wait a minute, "Delicious Bakery" is hardly a surprising name for a bakery.
There's a good chance that someone else also decided to name their bakery "Delicious Bakery".
In fact, here's [another bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/delicious-greensboro) 
in Greensboro, NC, also called "Delicious Bakery".
In fact, Delicious Bakery in Greensboro uses the domain delicious-cakes.com/
to advertise themselves.
Its possible they tried to use delicious-bakery.com as well,
only to find out that it was already taken by you the owner of Delicious Bakery in Northright, 
and decided that delicious-cakes.com would be an acceptable substitude.

Now think about how many business there are in the world, small and large,
that have some sort of web presense.
It's almost necessary to get any sort of credibility these days.
There's very well known software companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon,
and also many small shops like your neighborhood bakery,
all of which need a unique domain name for their business.

There's only one business that could own apple.com, or delicious-bakery.com, 
or monster.com. So if you plan to start a startup that
manufactures stuffed monsters for little children,
you're out of luck if you want to advertise your stuffed monsters 
on the domain monster.com.
You'll have to settle for monsters.com, or monster.io, or stuffed-monsters.com.
Perhaps not as memorable and simple as using monster.com, but ok nontheless.

All this has made some people realize that if they pre-emptively 
register for a domain name that a future startup might potentially want
(such as magic.com), then perhaps they could sell it to a buyer later
for much more than they purchased the domain name from the domain name registrar for.
GoDaddy (another domain name registrar) in fact has an [official page](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/5-tried-and-true-tips-for-buying-and-selling-domain-names-for-profit/)
dedicated to explaining how to make money by buying and selling domain names.
The people in the business of flipping internal real estate
have caused a shortage of desirable domain names, making their price hike.
