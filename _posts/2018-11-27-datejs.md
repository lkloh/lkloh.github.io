I'm in Pacific time zone now, `UTC-0800`.

Doing
```js
const Date = require(`datejs`);

const now = new Date(); // Tue Nov 27 2018 6:42:27 GMT+0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

but if you wrap it to json, you get
```js
const Date = require(`datejs`);

const now = new Date(); // Tue Nov 27 2018 6:42:27 GMT+0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
const nowStr = JSON.stringify(now); // 2018-10-28
```

This is because JSON.stringify actually does this:
```js
stringify(date) {
  return Date.toISOString(date);
}
```
which converts the date into UTC time.
Oh, and months start ordering from zero, not one.

DateJS is a really old library not really maintained anymore.
You're better off using something that's actively maintained, like momentJS.
