Since moving from Singapore to the United States seven years ago,
I've had to move around a lot,
mostly on my own with no help.

The biggest thing moving around has taught me,
is to only buy something you'll definitely use repeatedly, starting this week.
Not next month, not next year, not next season,
not when you lose weight or gain weight. Right now.
Anything that you won't use right now will probably never get used,
and get thrown out several months or years from now.

I learnt that the hard way.
My parents came with me to set me up for freshman year of college,
and of course they wanted to buy everything they thought I might need.
We came over their three huge bags, and bought even more stuff
that my mother insisted was useful.
Over several years of occasional visits, my parents helped me acquire:
Hair dryer, ironing board, iron , printer, 
clothes hangers (thrown away after I decided to only buy wrinkle-free clothes),
simple black high heel shoes 
(worn them about 5 times in 7 years), 
several pairs of jeans 
(thrown away because they were too tight after gaining the Freshman Fifteen),
dress shirt and pants 
(thrown away because they were too loose after losing the Freshman Fifteen), 
extra bottles of shampoo so I wouldn't need to run to the store so often without a car..

Honestly, they were quite reasonable compared to many other parents.
One of my friend's parents bought them a mini-fridge for their dorm room,
and she threw it out after a year of not using it.
I had a friend in grad school whose mother bought her at least 20 pairs of shoes,
and a giant wardrobe as well.
It caused her a huge pain when she moved.

Even then, I had 10 boxes of stuff at the end of freshman year.
It was a real pain to arrange for storage and move everything again.
Repeat several more times for each year of college,
the first year after graduating,
the move to grad school in a new state,
then the move back to California after grad school...
I learnt very quickly only to buy things I would definitely use very often. 
Anything else could be borrowed.
And to buy furniture that I wouldn't mind throwing away after one year
(a.k.a stuff that wasn't too expensive).

By the time I moved from Pennsylvania in grad school
back to San Francisco in California for a new position,
I had only two suitcases with me -- the same two suitcases
I had brought with me seven years ago from Singapore during my
initial move to college.
Since I had booked temporary housing in Berkeley for six weeks
to give me time to search for semi-permanent housing (a.k.a. a one-year lease)
in San Francisco, I would have to move again in California.
To minimize the amount of effort required to move, 
I sold my furniture in Pittsburgh for next to nothing,
and gave Goodwill two enormous bags full of rarely worn clothes.

Looking back, its kind of scary how much stuff I manage to accumulate every few months,
even with me consciously thinking before buying anything.
I was so careful about only buying stuff I would use multiple times,
that I slept on a pile of clothes for 10 days after moving to a new apartment 
while waiting for my mattress to arrive,
so I could avoid getting a sleeping bag that would contribute to clutter.
Maybe I'm taking my minimalist ways to the extreme.

On the other side of the spectrum,
my mother has kept our Enid Blyton storybooks for over twenty years,
awaiting the day my sister or I decide to procreate.
Perhaps I'll sneak them to a used books store the next time I visit.
