Suppose the domain name of an application is saucelabs.com.
You suspect there is an outage occuring on SauceLabs.
To see if you are right, go to status.saucelabs.com to check.

Suppose the domain name of an application is slack.com
You suspect there is an outage occuring on Slack.
To see if you are right, go to status.slack.com to check.

Suppose you are using an application in which the domain is interestingApp.com.
You suspect there is an outage occuring on interestingApp.
Where should you go to verify your hypothesis?

## Note

Check their Twitter handle if status.interestingApp.com
does not correspond to a page that described uptime of interestingApp.

## Note 2 

This probably only applies to major U.S. companies.
