When making up a JSON data structure with only one attribute, writing it as
```py
person = {'name': firstName + lastName}
```
may seem like a space saving gesture,
but writing it as
```py
person = {
  'name': first_name + last_name,
}
```
may work better when working on a large project as it allows people 
to change the structure in the future or add to it
and have it show up very obviously in a git diff.

I did not learn that in school.
