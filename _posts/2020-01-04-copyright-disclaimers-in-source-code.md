Summarized from [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/19649/copyright-notices-disclaimers-in-source-files/19653#19653).

Lots of open/closed-source projects have copyright notices in every source code file, which takes up lots of space in the source code, and which is so common place that most people probably don't read it. The reason for placing the copyright notice in each source code file, instead of adding a pointer to the license for that code repository the file lives in, is so that if the code gets scattered and imported to a different repository, the copyright continues to be asserted.

According to lawyers, having the copyright statement be clear is critical to enforcing your copyrights if you ever need to.
