```
The following page(s) have become unresponsive.
You can wait for them to become responsive or kill them.
```

What to do when you get that message while browsing the web?

Its usually better to kill the page and restart the browser.
The page you tried to load may just be taking a long time to load 
and would eventually become responsive if you wait long enough,
but its best not to try again without a least killing other tabs
that may be using a lot of CPU as well.
