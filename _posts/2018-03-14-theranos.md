title: "Theranos and only investing in things you understand"

So by now the truth about Theranos is out, and it's a fraud.
It's technology didn't work properly,
but instead of closing the company down when they figured out that the 
technology didn't work, the leaders instead chose to conceal things
and sue employees who raised concerns.

The board of director's was composed of very senior people in high positions,
but almost none of them had relevant experience to oversee a company
specializing in medical technology.
The company refused to be open about how their technology worked,
citing fears of competitors stealing their ideas instead
of publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals 
to obtain ideas for improvement from qualified professionals.

Lesson learnt: never be associated with or invest in a company 
(no matter how talented they are at marketing) unless you
understand the field well - first said by Warren Buffett.

It also reminds me of one of the pitfalls YCombinator warned startup founders about
- spending too much time and effort raising money and talking to investors
instead of building a useful product.
It's very tempting to spend money networking and talking to investors,
but the main thing a founder should be doing is making a minimum viable product,
launching it to users, and iterating on feedback.
