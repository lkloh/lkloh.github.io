Sure I've got by a lot with just looking at the error output of a Python program,
but [PDB](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html) is essentially 
[GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) for Python.

Insert
```
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
```
into the region of the program you want to break at and you can step through.
