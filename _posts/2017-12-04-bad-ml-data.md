Some machine learning algorithms train on lousy datasets.
Garbage in => garbage out.
Call this Algo A.

Then the next person comes along with a worse algorithm, Algo B,
that produces more accurate real world results,
because Algo B was trained on a better dataset.

So actually Algo A is a better algorithm,
but because the authors used a lousy dataset, Algo B's authors
got the recognition instead.
