Summarized from [here](https://designmodo.com/designers-developers-work/).

## Web designer

* Uses graphic design tools like Photoshop and Illustrator.
* Decides how the website looks

## Developer

* Make the website work on the web

## Working together - Designer

* Explain how elements interact during the design process
* Design everything - don't expect the developer to look at similar bits and copy them.
* If you're not sure if a font would work well on the web page,
  or if an animation you propose can fit in the project timeline, ask early
* Give design elements in the appropriate resolution for use in production

## Working together - Developer

* Understand a bit about design and its lingo. 
  Take a couple of free/cheap design classes online.
* If the designer proposes something that is likely to take a long time
  and delay the project, speak up early.
* Get involved in the design process from the start.
* Make sure elements have a consistent look when coding them,
  even if you don't agree with the look. Consistency is important. 

## Both

* How web fonts work
* Design trends
* What does the user want? 
* Sizing images
