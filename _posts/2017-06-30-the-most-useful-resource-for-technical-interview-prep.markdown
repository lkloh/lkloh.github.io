Author introduction: 
I'm LK Loh. I just got a master's degree in Computer Engineering
from Carnegie Mellon University and
recently started a position as a software engineer in San Francisco,
after spending several weeks
preparing for technical interviews using Pramp and other resources.

There's been a lot written about how to prepare for technical interviews,
which essentially boils down to three points:
* Know your data structures and algorithms well
* Understand the fundamentals of computer systems and their limitations
* Practice the above on a whiteboard

Even more has been written about how to do the above. 
People have built [businesses](https://www.interviewcake.com/) 
and [entire careers](http://www.gayle.com/) around helping 
others to prepare for such interviews. 
And I've personally used quite a few of those resources to help me prepare. 

Some of those resources that I've personally used are the [above book](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), 
[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/), 
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), 
and [CodeFights](https://codefights.com/).
They are certainly necessary if you need to learn the fundamentals
of data structures and algorithms,
but if you already know that stuff (as I did),
then they shouldn't be the only resource you turn to if you're
preparing for technical interviews.

Assuming you already know your algorithms, 
the problem with using only the above resources
is that either way, you're practicing alone. 
Most of the problems they offer are theoretically interesting, 
but doing a lot of them gets repetitive really quick. 
And unless you've got really strong willpower,
its fairly easy to lose focus once that happens. 
Or you feel like giving up after hacking at a hard problem for an hour
and the online judge keeps saying your test case doesn't pass due to this weird edge case. 

I would **love** to proclaim that I have really strong willpower
and can keep hacking on problem solving non-stop,
but the fact is that I often rely on external factors to motivate me.
Heck, on weekends, 
I wouldn't work at home because there are too many distractions there.
Instead, I'll spend $3 on coffee at a cafe so that I can sit there and work instead.
I need to be surrounded by other people who are working as well
to push myself to get stuff done.
Some people may say I'm throwing $3 into the rubbish bin everytime I'm doing that,
but I prefer the term "investment".
Besides, I'm supporting local businesses while I'm there!
I did have a roommate in grad school who could concentrate just as intensely
at home as in the office, 
but most of us don't have that particular superpower.

In any case, I used all the above resources to prepare for a technical phone screen 
at a well known software company headquartered in Mountain View.
They certainly helped, as I got an onsite interview after that.
That company sent me a long, long list of data structures and algorithms
that I should know like the back of my hand in order to do well at the onsite, 
so I asked for one month to give myself time to prepare.

During that month, I spent half my time 
practicing traditional interview questions on various online judges,
and the other half studying up on concepts I was weak at.
Because I'm really bad at concentrating on anything requiring hard focus in my apartment,
I invested a lot of money (perhaps $8 a day) to sit at local coffee shops while studying. 
At least, $8 is a lot of money when you're earning
what a typical graduate student makes.

By the time I flew out for the onsite interview,
I thought I had it nailed.
After all, I had spent the better part of a month
practicing problems on LeetCode -- but boy I was wrong.
It was really hard to come up with things on the fly and explain them well.
I thought I had practiced a lot with nailing the most optimal
solutions in a variety of scenarios,
but explaining it clearly to another human being was very difficult,
especially since I was obviously in a pretty stressful situation.
By the midway point, I already knew I was going to be rejected.
 
After the interview, 
the first thing I did was to pass out in my hotel room. 
Being in interview mode for six hours is tiring.
Then, I used one of that company's services 
to learn about [Pramp](https://pramp.com/#/),
which (as you should know if you're reading this),
lets you get interview by a real human being for free.
In particular, Pramp pairs you with another human being (a.k.a. a peer) who
is searching for a software engineering position as well,
so you can both take turns interviewing each other.
I saw a couple of good reviews on Reddit about Pramp, 
so I decided to test them out later.
Additionally, I also learnt about [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/),
which lets you get interviewed by a human being for free.
I couldn't find many reviews about them,
but decided to check them out later anyway.

Well, my first interview at Pramp didn't go well,
but not because the question I was asked was particularly tough.
Because I was a new user, Pramp matched me to someone who had used the platform already,
and he interviewed me first. 
I did a decent enough job at answering the question well,
and then it was time to switch to me being his interviewer instead.
Instead, I stupidly pressed the "end interview" button and
terminated the connection permanently. 
Boy, he must have been pissed. I would be pissed in his place. 
There was nothing I could do but give him an excellent review,
and then contact Pramp to see if they could pass on my apologies to him. 
I wrote to `hello@pramp.com` to explain what happened,
and one of the cofounders got back to me. 
He very kindly (1) removed the negative review of me,
and (2) asked me if there was something problematic UI that caused that incidents.
I told him that there wasn't,
because it was my own stupid fault for pressing the wrong button.

Anyway, I continued using Pramp with more success, and many other interview peers.
It's a lot easier to focus and push through a hard problem when there 
is a real human being there judging you,
so you want to focus and give your very best at each and every practice session.
It's really useful to be able to hold a two-way conversation with a real human being
about the technical tradeoffs when solving a problem.
Some people might say that a rubber ducky would work just as well,
but for me, strong and silent gets boring really quickly.

While most of the people I was paired with were interviewing for jobs like myself,
one of my interview partners turned out to be a hiring manager from Amazon.
He told me he had used Pramp to prepare for interviews,
and decided to use it again to search for candidates for his team.
I must have impressed him sufficiently as he 
later recommended me for an onsite interview at Amazon!
So, users of Pramp, treat every interview like its a real one -- 
because my practice session on Pramp essentially served
as my technical phone screen.

Probably because of the gender distribution in tech, 
almost all of the people I got paired on Pramp with were guys.
Now, there has been a lot said elsewhere about how
ladies in tech sometimes face negative treatment due to their gender,
but I can confidently say that each and every one of my (mainly male) peers
had treated me with the utmost professionalism.
Likely some of that could be credited to Pramp's rating system,
where the average of your past peer's reviews stares at you in the face the moment you log on.
It certainly served as an extra incentive for me
to be helpful and respectful during my practice sessions.

The only complaint about Pramp I had
was that there are a limited number of questions (~50) in their database,
so once I started running low on questions on Pramp, I turned to interviewing.io.
They are also a platform for practicing technical interview questions,
but your interviewer is a professional software engineer who already has a job,
who picks any question he wants to ask.
The general idea business model of interviewing.io is to 
let job seekers anonymously practice interviewing with hiring managers.
If they do well, perhaps the hiring manager could choose to invite
them onsite to interview for a position at their company.
Great idea in practice... but the real problem was the balancing issue.
As you might expect, there are a lot more people looking for jobs on interviewing.io
than there are hiring managers,
so it got really difficult to schedule interviews there.
I got maybe one interview per week on interviewin.io, 
while I could schedule interviews every two hours on Pramp.

Can't blame interviewing.io, obviously. 
Their ultimate goal is to connect job seekers with hiring managers,
and giving people the chance to practice
is just a nice side effect of their business model. 
Plus, they were still in beta when I signed up for them. 
The problem is that people who already have a full-time job
have more important things to do than interview random people on the internet.
Heck, I told Pramp that I would write this article after I started my job
(thanks in no small part due to them!),
and it ended up taking me two weeks to push it out.
Between working full-time and arranging for affordable housing in San Francisco 
(that's worth a different article in itself...)
I didn't have much mental energy left to write this up until now.
Forever sorry, Pramp.
Still, it just shows that Pramp's way to help job-seekers practice
is a really good idea, because they've found a way to ensure
everyone interviewing has a strong motivation to do their best
and help others do their best as well.
If you're looking for a software engineering position,
you should definitely check them out!
