Recently I added a new error message as part of a
series of messages on a website.
It used active voice while the rest used passive voice.
I really should have made it passive voice as well,
just to be consistent with the rest of the user-facing communications,
even though the passive voice is considered bad.
Or checked with someone else about changing everything to active voice.
