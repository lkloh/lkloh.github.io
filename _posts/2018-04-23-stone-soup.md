There's a fairytale about the old woman who asked a farmer for ingredients to make
soup did not get them.
She threw a stone in and said the "stone soup" would takes better with a potato,
then a carrot, then salt, then chicken, ..., etc,
until finally she let the farmer taste it and he thought it was good.

Similarly, if you want to get something big done,
don't ask for permission for everything you would like done to be done,
or you will never get it.

Ask to do a small portion of it that will take a couple days.
Show everyone how it improves things.
Then when they are excited, state that it would be even better to get
this done, and then something else, ... until the big change is finished.

This applies to everything in life - making big changes is a recipe for failure.
Start with something small and build on it.
