Symantec issues test certificates in some unregistered domains,
or domains owner by other organizations, such as those belonging to Google.
Supposedly it was done as part of their QA process because issuing certificates
to unregistered domains was allowed at one point,
but later disallowed.
Presumably upgrading legacy software takes a while and some people didn't bother immediately,
until it was [too late](http://archive.is/Ro70U).

Tech debt is been called due.
