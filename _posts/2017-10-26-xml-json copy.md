XML/JSON are like cardboard](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3143320), 
because you can use them to package almost anything
to transport it safely from point A to point B.

## Advantages

* One-size fit all:
...Cardboard: used to pack almost any personal belonging (clothes/books/toiletrie/...)
...JSON/XML: can hold data of almost any representation

* Transport mechanism agnostic
...Cardboard: You can send a cardboard box full of stuff by plane/air/ship/..., between england/france/singapore/kenya/... doesn't matter
...JSON/XML: You can send data across two endpoints constructed of different frameworks, using almost any transport protocol

## Disadvantages

* Additional packaging needed, increasing costs of transport
...Cardboard: Some items packaged in cardboard may need lots of padding inside to keep it safe and undamaged, but the extra cost is worth it for the convenience. Example is sending an iPhone from China to America.
...JSON/XML: Extra boilerplate code needed to encapsulate data in the right format, but the convenience offered by packaging the data in an easy-to-parse, widely known form is worth the little bit more bandwidth you need to use.
