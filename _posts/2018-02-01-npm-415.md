A 415 error means the payload format is not accepted by the server. 
Happened in the past to some npm packages that were [too large](https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/msyss994gf66).

Some people suggest creating a local npm mirror as a failsave when npm outages occur
(which happen often enough to affect businesses): http://www.remotecto.net/2013/06/20/how-to-create-an-npm-repository-mirror/.
