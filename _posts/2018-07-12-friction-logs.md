Summarized from [here](https://devrel.net/developer-experience/an-introduction-to-friction-logging).

## What a Friction log is

Documentation of areas where a product targeted at developers is hard to use.

## What a friction log is not

A bug report. Just because a product is hard to use, doesn't mean it works wrongly.

## Why its useful to keep one at a company

* Puts user issues in context: explains the user experience from start to finish,
  so one can call attention to how the whole product fits together,
  and how it works (or doesn't work) with other products.
* Helps develop user empathy
* Lets product managers know about particularly excellent/problematic parts of the user experience
