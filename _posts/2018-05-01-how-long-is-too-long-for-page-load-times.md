Pages should load within [4 seconds](https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/),
but that is not always possible.

If you're upgrading a production system and the old page was hanging,
but your new page reloads in 30 seconds,
its probably ok to deploy now and refactor later.
You still improved production, even if its not ideal.
