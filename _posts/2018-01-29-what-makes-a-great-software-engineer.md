Summarized from _Li, Paul Luo, Andrew J. Ko, and Jiamin Zhu. "What makes a great software engineer?." In Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering-Volume 1, pp. 700-710. IEEE Press, 2015._

## Why this article matters

There is lots of career advice in popular culture about what makes a good engineer/
professional worker in general, 
but most of it either is not specific to software engineering,
or is to broad to be useful.

For example, many people are advised to "learn on the job", "be creative", "be nice",
but such sweeping statements don't always provide good guidance for specific scenarios
that a software engineer may encounter on the job.

Also, many academic studies on traits of effective software engineers 
focused on new hires out of college, not those who are more senior.

## How the authors conducted their study

Interviewed experienced engineers at Microsoft (first author is employed there full time).
Those interviewed are at least one level above "new grad".



# Personal Characteristics that make a software engineer great

## Always improving their skills

Technology advances quickly, if you're not keeping up you're falling behind.

## Passionate

About what they are working on. 
Alignment between the engineer's interest and their work is critically important for success.

## Open-minded

Software products are always changing - thus engineers must be open
to changing their understanding.

## Data-driven

Listen to the data and don't come up with excuses for why the data doesn't apply to you
if it makes things inconvenient.



# Decision Making

## Knowledgable about the people in the organization they work for

How the engineer fits into the big picture with others is important.
Also, people are the best resource for questions, not just documentation.

## Seeing the big picture

Engineers often work on a tiny part of a project, but they 
need to understand how it fits in with the broaded goals of the organization
to be effective on prioritizing work.

## Mental models

Industry trends, technical details -- these keep changing and have to be updated 

## Handling complexity

Relates to having an accurate mental model of things to deal with complex technical issues,
especially in large organizations like Microsoft with multiple interconnected layers of the stack.



## Teamwork

## Communicating context effectively

With code reviewers, product managers, marketing people ...
knowing how to talk to these people at the appropriate level of context is important,
as everyone is working together to help the organization as a whole.

## Making others successful

Someone else's success/failure is also your success/failure,
so help people as necessary. 

## Failing well

Pain is the best teacher... but only if you don't die after making a mistake,
but get bruised enough to learn from it and laugh it off.

## Honestly

Tell people the trust, not what they want to hear

## Personal accountability

When things go wrong, fix it instead of trying to assign blame.
That goes for individual contributors and managers.



# Software product

## Elegance

Make designs as simple as possible, for long term maintainability.

## Creative

New problems come up often, so new ideas are needed to solve the problem

## Not reinventing the wheel

But if a known problem comes up, use known tools to solve it instead
of wasting time and energy to come up with something new.

## Future-proofing design

Anticipate possible future requirements to the software
if the cost is not too high.

If the cost is high, do not future proof, instead be prepared to refactor later on.


# Takeaways

* Tools that help people be well mannered in emails/reviewing pull requests would be great to have.
  The article was published in 2015; Gmail already has a preliminary version!

* Tools to help evaluate trade-offs when making decisions would also be great.
  Great, but building a generic tool for different companies sounds quite hard.
  The person/people who can do this effectively will be very rich though.

* Lots of traits to make a great software engineer cannot be taught in schools,
  only real world scenarios can teach them.
