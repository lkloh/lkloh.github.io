title: "Resource Aquisition Is Initialization (RAII) in C++"
---

Summarized from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35859942/the-difference-between-raii-and-smart-pointers-in-c).

In RAII, resource acquisition happens when initialization does, so the resource will be held between then initialization finishes and finalization starts, and is only held when the object is alive. Thus if no object leaks, there are no resource leaks. C++ uses this concept to automatically call the destructor for stack objects.

Heap objects can leak as the onus is on the caller to remember to deallocate the memory when the object is no longer used. Smart pointers like `unique` and `shared` can help with this by managing the memory automatically though.
