This article outlines the best arguments I've seen for how _you_, the average human being, can look on the bright side of net neutrality being struck down.

## No more #tooMuchInformation

In this Social Media age, many people post stuff without thinking it through, and the results aren't always pretty. Perhaps if we need to pay more to read Twitter, we only following users who tweet with care.

## Less online shopping

If you had to pay more to buy stuff online, maybe you'll buy only what you need, not something that looked "cute". You're probably save money and the environment in the long run.

## Websites that promote false information

Websites such as [these](http://www.creationism.org/) would have less traffic.

## Reading StackOverflow at work, not watching cat videos

If your employer had to pay more for internet access in the office, maybe they would pay for quick StackOverflow access, but not sites that show cat videos.

## Adult entertainment will cost more

Self explanatory.

That said, [go Scott Wiener](http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/365058-california-state-senator-to-propose-statewide-net-neutrality-laws)!
