This article outlines the best arguments I've seen for how _you_,
the average human being, can look on the bright side of net neutrality 
being struck down.

## #tooMuchInformation ==> #wellThoughtOutInformation

In the Social Media age,
many people post stuff without thinking it through,
and the results aren't always easy to observe.
Perhaps if we need to pay more to read Twitter,
we would be more discerning about only following users
who think carefully before posting.

## Less online shopping

If you had to pay more to buy something online,
maybe you'll buy only what you need,
not something that looked "cute".

## Websites that promote false information

Websites such as [these](http://www.creationism.org/) would have less traffic. 


## Reading StackOverflow at work, not watching cat videos

If your employer had to pay more for internet access in the office,
maybe they would pay for StackOverflow access,
and throttle cat videos.

## Adult entertainment will cost more

The title says it all.
