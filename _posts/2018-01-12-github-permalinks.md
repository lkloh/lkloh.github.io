When reviewing pull requests in Github, to reference a particular code block,
you can use [embedded code snippets](https://github.com/blog/2415-introducing-embedded-code-snippets)
to ensure all the information needed can be directly shown on a comment. 
Essentially you highlight the lines to reference on a piece of code hosted on
Github, rightclick and grab the permalink to that bit of code.

One of the features they introduced recently, on August 15 last year, but so useful.
Somehow I missed the update - maybe they sent out an email that I didn't get
since I unsuscribe from all but comments on work that is directly relevant to me.
