tl;dr: Control for performance when performing A/B tests on websites.

This study on best practices for 
[website experimentation](http://exp-platform.com/rules-of-thumb/)
essentially says that the best thing you could do is to 
speed up your website's response time.
The data is clear: 
the single best thing you could do to attract more revenue-generating users
is to speed up your website's response time.

Other things you may want to experiment with
like tweaking the CSS styles,
or show a certain ad at the payments page instead of the home page,
are good to experiment on as they could lead to big gains.
But you need to control for the website's response time
when experimenting with them.
Only bother if your website is actually fast first.
Work on that big engineering problem first,
before worrying about something easier like messing with the CSS styles.
