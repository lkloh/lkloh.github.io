## Intro

* Web services access protocol
* More rigid than REST for standardization
* Relies on XML only

## Why REST was developed when there is SOAP

SOAP is inflexible 
* Using SOAP in JavaScript needs lots of boilerplate to create XML
* REST uses a simple URL
* REST outputs data in multiple forms => easy to customize to your needs

* Language, platform, transport independent. REST requires HTTP
* Standardized
* Automated Error handling
