Since moving from Singapore to the United States 7 years ago,
I've had to move around a lot,
mostly on my own with no help.

The biggest thing moving around has taught me,
is to only buy something you'll definitely start using repeatedly this week.
Not next month, not next year, not next season,
not when you lose weight or gain weight. Right now.
Anything that you won't use right now will probably never get used,
and get thrown out several months or years from now.

I learnt that the hard way.
My parents came with me to set me up for freshman year of college,
and of course they wanted to buy everything they thought I might need.
We came over their three huge bags, and bought even more stuff
that my mother insisted was useful.
Over several years of occasional visits, my parents helped me acquire:
Hair dryer, ironing board, iron , printer, 
clothes hangers (thrown away after I decided to only buy wrinkle-free clothes),
simple black high heel shoes 
(worn them about 5 times in 7 years), 
several pairs of jeans 
(thrown away because they were too tight after gaining the Freshman Fifteen),
dress shirt and pants 
(thrown away because they were too lose after losing the Freshman Fifteen), 
extra bottles of shampoo so I wouldn't need to run to the store so often without a car..

Honestly, they were actually quite reasonable compared to many other parents.
Some people's parents bought them a mini-fridge for their dorm room.
I had a roommate in grad school whose mother bought her at least 20 pairs of shoes,
and a giant wardrobe as well.
It caused her a huge pain when she had to put everything into 
storage for a summer internship.

Even then, I had 10 boxes of stuff at the end of freshman year.
It was a real pain to arrange for storage and move everything again.
Repeat several more times for each year of college,
the first year of work,
the move to grad school in a new state,
then the move back to California after grad school...
I learnt very quickly only to buy things I would definitely use very often. 
Anything else could be borrowed.
And to buy furniture that I wouldn't mind throwing away after one year
(a.k.a stuff that wasn't too expensive).

By the time I moved from Pennsylvania in grad school
back to San Francisco in California for a new position,
I had only two suitcases with me -- the same two suitcases
I had brought with me seven years ago from Singapore during my
initial move to college.
All my furniture had been sold for almost nothing/ given away,
and I had given two enormous trash bags of clothing that I rarely wore to Goodwill.
Somehow I managed to accumulate two enormous bags of clothes,
despite clothes shopping about once a year on average.
I had booked temporary housing in Berkeley for six weeks
to give me time to search for semi-permanent housing (a.k.a. a one-year lease)
in San Francisco, meaning I would have to move again in California.

It's kind of scary how much stuff I manage to accumulate every few months,
even with me consciously thinking before buying anything.
I was so careful about only buying stuff I would use multiple times,
that I slept on a pile of clothes for 10 days after moving to a new apartment in 
San Francisco while waiting for a mattress to arrive,
so I didn't need to get a sleeping bag.

And most people are far worse at parting with stuff than I am.
My mother still has all my Enid Blyton books,
awaiting the day my sister or I decide to procreate.
Maybe I'll sneak them to a used books store the next time I'm back.
