[This previous post]() discussed why people might buy certain domain names 
such as magic.com for a few dollars - in hopes that a business owner might later
buy it again from them for a substantial mark up when the business owner
needs the domain name for marketing online.
For example, Apple, Inc owns the domain apple.com,
mainly to host webpages to help people to buy more Apple Products.

How many people visit apple.com a day?
