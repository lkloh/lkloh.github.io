title: "Different types of C++ casts"
---

Summarized from [here](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-the-differences-among-static_cast-reinterpret_cast
-const_cast-and-dynamic_cast-to-a-new-C++-programmer).

## static_cast

Used for conversion between types that rely on compile-time type information. There are no run-time checks and no run
-time overhead. Try to use this if possible.

```c++
int a = 5;
double result = static_cast<double>(a) / 2;
```

## dynamic_cast

Only used with pointers and references to objects, and to handle polymorphism to make sure the result is valid. It
 does run time checking so there is runtime overhead.
 
```c++
class Shape {
public:  
  Shape(double area);
private:
  double area_;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
  Circle(double radius) : radius_(radius) {
    area_ = 3.14159 * radius * radius;
  }
private:
  double radius_;
};
```

One can cast a `Circle` to a `Shape`,
```c++
Circle c(7);
Shape *s = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(&c);
```
but not vice versa as going from a base to derived class is not allowed with dynamic cast.
```c++
Shape s(14);
Circle *c = dynamic_cast<Shape*>(&s);
```

## reinterpret_case

Used for casts that are not type-safe. It reinterprets the underlying bit pattern, but asking the compiler to treat
 the sequence of bits of expressions as if it has the type it is being cast to.

All pointer conversions are allowed, even base to derived class, because you are telling the compiler that you know
 what you are doing. This is considered unsafe coding as maybe sometimes you don't know what you're doing.
```c++
function (Shape* s) {
  Circle *c = reinterpret_cast<Circle*>(s);
}
```

However this cannot operate on a `const` pointer.

## const_cast

This is the only cast that can operate on a `const` object and modify it.

```c++
int a = 5;
const int& pA = &a;
int *pX = const_cast<int*>(pA); // make it non-const
*pX = 10;
std::cout << a << std::endl; // prints 10
```
