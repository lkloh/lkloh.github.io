I once went on a volunteer trip with my high school to teach
English to elementary school students in a remote location in China for 10 days.
I don't think I (or any of my classmates who came on the trip)
managed to teach them any English, 
but we did have lots of fun playing with the local students.
They cried non stop when we left.

Lots of college and employers value people who have done volunteer work,
but the type of volunteer work they value should probably be scrutinized more.
[This article](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22294205) 
highlights some of the negative effects of overseas volunteers, such as:

* Volunteers, especially young ones, don't have the skills to do a good job. 
Would you be happy if a 16 year old high school student was your child/niece/nephew's
English teacher? Yeah, thought not.
* The children you are trying to help see you once for a few days, get attached,
and never see you again. The instability hurts them a lot more than the
few days of joy helps. Especially since lots of volunteers from wealthier
places like to come and help out - once.
* Real change needs time. Helping out for 10 days does almost nothing.
The people who primarily benefitted from the trip was for my fellow classmates and I,
not the local students.
* The trip cost quite a bit of money, about $1000 from my parents for the plane ticket,
and at least $1000 more from government subsidies. 
There were at least 15 of us on the trip so that is > $30000 spent on a trip
that did very little good for the people who we were supposed to be helping.
The $30000 could most likely have been put to better use - in our own country,
or by donating it to professionals at a non-profit who actually knew what they were doing. 

Even when you're an adult, there's probably no point in volunteering
unless you really have specialised skills and can make a prolonged committment.
Otherwise you'll make a greater positive impact by
taking vacations in poorer nations and spending your money at local businesses.
That would ensure your money goes to enpowering the locals,
not some charity organization that may or may not be use donations in the most efficient way.
