"Fix problems ASAP."

## Broken Window Theory

Researchers in urban studies have found that the fastest way to make a building decay
is to leave a broken window unrepaired.
It gives people the sense that the owners don't care about the building,
so they stop caring as well and start littering, etc.
Very soon, the building is damaged beyond repair and condemned. 

## Fix broken windows in anything ASAP - even if all you do is board it up

In software, don't leave bad code 
(no tests, bad designs) hanging.
Take some action to fix it, if only to leave a comment
stating why you are leaving it like that and when you are going to fix it,
to communicate that someone is on top of a bad situation.

Neglect contributes to software rot faster than anything else.
