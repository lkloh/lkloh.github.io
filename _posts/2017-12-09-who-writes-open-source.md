title:  "Who writes open source software?"

Usually, the most widely used projects are mainly developed by people 
[employed by large corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Community). 
Certainly there are many contributors contributing for free in their spare time,
but its really hard to dig deep and focus on making an impact 
without being paid. Usually the most impactful contributors are being paid by a large corporation
that makes it part of their business to support open source software.
Just look at V8, or React, or Python.
It's not really possible to have enough time to dig deep if you're
working a full-time job to pay the bills after all.

The biggest contribution I made to open source software
was made over 2 months at a (paid) internship.
Other than that, my other "contributons" have mainly been raising issues 
and making feature requests (usually while at work).
