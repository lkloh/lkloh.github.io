I did TransPRK in Singapore on [December 10, 2018](https://lkloh.github.io/2019/01/01/transprk.html),
and went for a follow up in San Francisco, CA on February 24, 2019.
The surgeon who did TransPRK for me asked me to get checked for corneal clarity
(to ensure there was no scarring from UV light),
and eye pressure (which could have been affected by steroidal eyedrops).

Initially I called up an eye doctor in San Francisco,
and explained that I needed a follow-up for TransPRK done in a different country.
I was promptly told that the follow-up would cost $1500 for the year if the
doctor was willing to take my case, and it wasn't covered by insurance.

After that I called up a different eye doctor,
and explained that I was interested in checking my eye pression and corneal clarity.
I was told that it would be about $70 to do those two checks in a routine
eye exam, and possibly cheaper after my insurance coverage.
So I booked an appointment for the next opening they had on a Saturday.
The receptionist collected $10 for my copay once I checked in.

Next, the doctor checked my eyesight, found it to be "pretty good", about 20/30,
and that adding lenses didn't help with clairty.
She also checked my corneas and said that my left cornea had some haziness,
which was likely because it needed more healing time, 
no surprise as my right eye had always been ahead of schedule in terms of recovery.
My eye pressure was slightly high, but within the expected range for a healthy human being.
So pretty much I just had to keep wearning sunglasses and a hat whenever
outdoors for a couple more months while my eyes continue to heal.
