Summarized from [here](https://www.recode.net/2015/3/20/11560528/too-embarrassed-to-ask-wi-fi-v-bluetooth).

## Similarities

* Wireless
* Found in most laptops and smartphones

## Differences

* Usage: 
    Wifi is used to connect a device to the internet,
    or to create a local network to link multiple devices.
    Bluetooth is used to connect two devices together
    (e.g. laptop and a mouse).
* Range:
    Wifi's range is longer (size of an office),
    while Bluethood is shorter (~30 feet).
* Dependency:
    Wifi requires a third party device (e.g. router) to send out a 
    network signal strong enough to cover some area (e.g. a home).
    Bluetooth does not depend on any third party device.
