According to Wikipedia, when writing software, you should make sure the following hold:
* Components only talk to closely related components, and _as few of those as possible_
* Components talk to friends only
* Components talk to close friends only

Essentially - minimize dependencies.
Especially make sure you understand the dependencies you are forced to rely on well.
This helps avoid dependency hell.

NPM - I'm looking at some of your packages.
