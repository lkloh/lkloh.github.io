Everyone knows the Friday is a holiday,
and thus you should only ship code when [everyone else is at work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2115612/why-not-to-deploy-on-a-friday).

This Stack Overflow post lists the reasons to ship when everyone is at work:
* So you that you can clean up any bugs missed before deployment,
	which happens pretty often.
* So that users will check their work emails if you are changing 
	a tool they use for their own work.
	If you ship new code on a holiday,
	and they don't check their email over the holiday,
	they may get a surprise when they see the change,
	which may not always be welcome.
* New releases always have bugs.
	You want to have coworkers around you to help fix the bugs
	when they expect to be at work, 
	not bother them when they are on holiday.

## Gotchas:

You should ship on a Friday if you work for a dating app company.
