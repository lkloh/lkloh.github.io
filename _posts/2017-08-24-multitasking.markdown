[Studies](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0932633226) 
have shown that when you work on more than 2 projects at the same time,
your productivity goes way down due to the congitive overhead of task switching.
Even working on two projects at the same time causes a massive amount of 
time wasted due to context switching.
It's best to work on just one project at a time.
But it's hard to do that in most jobs,
so aim for no more than two.
Any more than two and you'll spend more time 
context switching than working on the project,
so you aren't helping anyone by trying to take on more than you can handle.

Example: When I was fixing bugs that occurred in 
software projects that were already marked as "completed",
it could take days for someone else to review it,
because they had move on to working on other projects
and didn't want to break the concentration.
When working on an ongoing project with other people,
I typically got code reviews within an hour,
because other people were thinking about the same
sorts of things I was working on,
so transitioning from their work to looking
at the related stuff I've done was easy for them.
