Summarized from [here](https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl-information-center/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/).

An SSL Certificate is a data file stored on a web server that connects 
an organization to its public encryption key.
It enables the establishment of a secure connection from the organization's web server to a 
user's browser via the SSL/TLS encryption protocol.
Thus, all the traffic between the web server and the user's browser would be secure,
which is important when sensitive information such as passwords and 
credit cards are transmitted.

When users visit a website with an SSL Certificate installed,
the browser would show a green padlock sign at the navigator.
