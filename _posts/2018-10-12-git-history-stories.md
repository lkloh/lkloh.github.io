In order for your git history to be useful,
[here](https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/telling-stories-with-your-git-history) 
are some tips:

## Keep commits small and meaningful

Instead of having one huge change in a commit with lots of unrelated changes,
break down each individual change in a single commit.

## Write meaningful commit messages

`Added tooltip explaining what the LOOKOUT button does`
instead of `Added tooltip`.

## Revise history before asking for feedback

When working on a branch, you might often make mistakes or typos.
Refactor the commits so they tell a clear story before asking for a review.
Your commits should make it easy to see what your pull request does,
instead of being a blow-by-blow log of what things you tried
and failed to do.
