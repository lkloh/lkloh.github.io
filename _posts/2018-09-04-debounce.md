Summarize from [here](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function).

The [debounce function](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function)
should be used when you use JavaScript to do something that will consume lots of CPU.
It rate limits firing to prevent the browser performance from degrading too much.

```js
var debounced_resize = debounce(() => {
  // do something computationally intensive
  const newDimensions = this.updateDimensions();
  this.repositionElements(newDimensions);
}, 250);

// fires only once every 250 milliseconds
window.addEventListener(`resize`, debounced_resize);
```

By forcing the resize function to only fire every 250 milliseconds,
instead of whenever it is triggered, you get a performance boost.

As for the rate at which a function _should_ fire
- you'll need to tests a few speeds for usability and performance.
No standard guidelines.
