[Eventlet](http://eventlet.net/) is a Python library to allow you to run code concurrently.
It uses green threads for concurrent work.
Green threads are better than normal threads as they are cheap,
and shared data structures don't need locks.

Usage example:
```py
from eventlet.greenpool import GreenPile
import numpy as np

def process_data(file):
	// process_data
	return array

// return processes array quickly
def parallize_processing(file):
	pile = GreenPile(size_or_pool=10)
	files = divide_up_files(file, num_divided_files=5)
	for i in range(5):
		pile.spawn(process_data, files[i])
	return np.concatenate([arr for arr in pile]).ravel().tolist()
``` 

This would speed up processing of a large file by 5 times.

## Gotchas

GreenPool lets you specify the total number of threads in the entire program.
This would limit the resources the entire program uses.

GreenPile lets you specify the number of threads you want to use to do something.
Many greenpiles can be produced in a same program,
so doing so does not limit the resources the entire program can use.

When in doubt, use a GreenPool as a global variable 
to limit the resoures the entire program consumes.
