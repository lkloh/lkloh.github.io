title:  "How work on a remote filesystem with Sublime Text"

My intro to programming class was taught in Java,
so my first text editor was Eclipse.
The next class was in C++, 
and the recommended text editor was VisualStudio,
which I used.
After that was a class on computer systems,
and you could use either Vim or Emacs.
I went with Emacs because it seemed slightly easier to learn than Vim.
It wasn't stable when I had to SSH into the remote servers
to do the work though.
Vim was a lot more stable, but the work was tough enough without learning 
a new text editor like Vim.
So Emacs it was for that class, but I never liked it much.
My first dev job after college was at a startup,
where I was introduced to Sublime Text.
I never used anything else again,
they just made it too easy to use and the messages asking me to 
pay up aren't too annoying. 
Maybe I'll learn Vim if Sublime Text makes them more irritating. 

In the meantime, if you need to work on a codebase in a remote server,
and want to use your favourite text editor on your laptop,
[sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) is your friend.

Install it. Make a directory called `mountpoint` on your laptop. Run
```
sshfs user@hostname:directory mountpoint 
```
Now you can work off the codebase in `mountpoint` like
everything is actually located on your laptop,
but changes you make in Sublime Text will reflect
in the remote directory when you press `Save`.
