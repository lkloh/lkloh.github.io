Not the greatest idea in software engineering.
If you need to make a pull request to add one feature now,
don't add stuff that you might need _later_ when you expand the scope of things.
Feature requirements can change quite a bit in several days,
so you only risk adding to the complexity of the code base today
and making development harder tomorrow.
