title: "Recovering from TransPRK"

While there was no pain from the surgery itself, 
the contact lenses felt very uncomfortable and scratchy for the first few hours.
Everything was also blurry as the surgery had just created a wound in my eyes
that needed to heal first, so I couldn't read anything.
I ended up listening to introductory Portuguese audiotapes instead
as I had planned to learn Portuguese for a while, and thought
the downtime after TransPRK would be an ideal time to get started.
My learning was interrupted every hour by needing to put about 4 different
kinds of eyedrops.

There was more of the same for the second day.
