The first day was of course the hardest. While there was no pain from the surgery itself, 
the contact lenses felt very uncomfortable and scratchy for the first few hours.
Everything was also blurry as the surgery had just created a wound in my eyes
that needed to heal first, so I couldn't read anything.
I ended up listening to introductory Portuguese audiotapes instead
as I had planned to learn Portuguese for a while, and thought
the downtime after TransPRK would be an ideal time to get started.
My learning was interrupted every hour by needing to put about 4 different
kinds of eyedrops, and I decided not to wash my hair to avoid water in my eyes.

There was more of the same for the second day.
Lots of eyedrops every hour, to the point where I had to set an alarm
to remind myself of when to put them.
I also had been advised to avoid crowded areas for the first three days
after surgery, so I couldn't leave my parents' house.
As with the first day, I could barely read anything,
so I listened to more audiotapes on Portuguese.
I was using the Pimsler series, which are a set of 30 minute long lessons.
Since I couldn't read, I had to guess how some words were spelled,
and wasn't always correct. For example, I had thought that
"com licensa" - meaning "excuse me" was spelled "cauli sansa",
and didn't get that error corrected until almost two weeks later.
I also discovered that I needed to listen to each Portuguese lesson
3 times to get the hang of it,
and that I couldn't really get through more than 2 of them a day,
as my the third lesson, my brain somehow would stop learning new works.
So I had a lot of free time to kill and very fews ways to kill it.
I took three showers, brushed and flossed my teeth after every meal,
and spent a lot of time talking to my mother.

On the third day, I finally could leave the house,
but only for a check up. The doctor confirmed everything was fine,
and then it was back to more Portuguese lessons and listening
to whatever TED talk I happened to click on
(my vision wasn't yet good enough to read the titles).

From the fourth day onwards, I decided it was safe enough
to leave the house in the early morning or late evening when the sun was dim,
wearing sunglasses and a cap of course, so things got a little better.

On the sixth day, I went for another follow up, 
when my contact lenses were removed.
I was given more eyedrops and instructions to continue wearing
sunglasses outdoors to avoid UV rays, which could cause scaring.

By the end of the first week, vision in my right eye had become decent enough
for me to read simple things on my phone
(and for me to realise I had been listening to the European Portuguese lessons
instead of the Brazilian Portuguese lessons),
but my left eye was still very blurry.

Vision continued to improve steadily for the second week in my right eye,
but my left eye continued to be blurry. I was worried for a while
but my vision finally cleared up on Christmas Day 2018.
I didn't realize that immediately as I also woke up with hives
covering every part of my body except my face (luckily)
due to some food I must have eaten that caused an allergic reaction.
So my Christmas morning was spend hunting for a doctor who was still seeing patients
on Christmas instead of celebrating the new clarity in my left eye.

On Boxing day, 16 days after my surgery, I went for my final checkup in Singapore.
The doctor said that everything looked fine, but there was still a lot of healing
to be done - expected as while I could now read pretty well,
so things from afar were still fairly blur.
I was asked to continue to avoid strong sunlight and putting eyedrops,
and to go for a checkup with an eye doctor in the US in 2 months.

And that's it for updates. Vision still isn't at 100% but good enough 
that I can function normally. I'll post more updates at the 2 month and 6 month mark,
when my vision is expected to finally have stabilized.
