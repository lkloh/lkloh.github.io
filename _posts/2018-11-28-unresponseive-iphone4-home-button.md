title: "Fixing a broken iPhone (4) home button"

My iPhone 4's home button stopped working, which was a problem.
Turning it off and on again didn't work, though it often fixes lots of technical problems

So I turned on [accessibility mode](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/four-ways-to-fix-an-unresponsive-iphone-home-button/)
which basically displays the home button on the screen itself everywhere.
Not ideal but ok in a pinch.

Of course, the home button magically started working a day later.
But I decided it was a sign that it was absolutely time to shell out for
a [more upgraded phone](https://www.apple.com/iphone-8/specs/).
I ended up with the iPhone 8, as the iPhone X had a more upgraded camera
and facial recognition, but I didn't see myself really needing to pay $400 more for that.
