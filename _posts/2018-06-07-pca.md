Summarized from [here](https://elitedatascience.com/dimensionality-reduction-algorithms#feature-extraction).

## What it is

Unsupervised learning algorithm, used to reduce dimensionality.

## How it reduces dimensionality

Create linear combinations of the original features that are orthogonal "uncorrelate",
and ranked in order of explained variance.

First principal component (PC1) - explains most variance in dataset,
PC2 - explains second most variance, ....
Reduce dimensionality by limiting the number of principal components to keep,
by keeping only those take explain most of the variance in the datasets.

## Gotchas

* Normalize the dataset before PCA, else features that are the largest scale
would dominate the variance (whether or not they deserve to).
* The new principal components cannot be interpreted/ correlated
  to the variables contributing to their variance.
* Need to manually tune a threshold to pick principal components.
