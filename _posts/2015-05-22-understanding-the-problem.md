title: "Understanding the problem"

[This article](https://blog.intercom.com/great-product-managers-dont-spend-time-on-solutions/)
argues that one should spend a decent amount of tie understanding a problem,
before even designing a solution to it.
Many companies prefer to prioritize a problem,
then jump to coding and getting a beta product out.
Apparently this leads to many products/startups that fail,
as designing a good solution requires full understanding of a problem,
which requires taking to customers and customer-facing staff.

That would help avoid the scenario where one gets to beta before realizing
that they built a product that people didn't want.
Many do not spend the time understanding the problem and defining it well
as the outputs are not as cool as having a beta version out to play with,
so its harder to sell value to management.
