Summary from [here](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/cname-record/).

CNAME: Canonical name.
Its records are used to alias names.

Example
* Canonical name: `google.com`
* Alias: `googld.com` (in case someone made a typo)

Then the person making a typo who entered `googld.com` still hit the google homepage.
