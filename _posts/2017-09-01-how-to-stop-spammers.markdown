When you receive lots of mail from a `<xxx@annoying-domain.com>`,
one thing you could do is to set a filter to automatically delete 
anything coming from `annoying-domain.com`.
That will stop annoying emails coming to _you_.

To do something a little more drastic,
you could mark the email as spam.
[Google](https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/6070440?hl=en) takes it pretty seriously,
their info page says that someone on the 
Gmail spam team will investigate that report.

If you want to hit them where it hurts:
complain to the general email spam reporting services,
such as [SpamCop](https://www.spamcop.net) 
and [SpamHaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/).
Almost all the email service providers rely on those. 
So the spammer is further deterred use some other email provider such as 
`annoying-domain-version-2.com` to spam you. 

Or you could also complain directly to their ISP.
That would probably get you a really quick response.
