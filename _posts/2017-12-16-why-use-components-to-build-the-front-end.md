Most modern front end development [uses components](https://derickbailey.com/2015/08/26/building-a-component-based-web-ui-with-modern-javascript-frameworks/). The article that since components encapsulate a set of behaviors (e.g. a generic dropdown list) and talk to each other via interfaces only, they make it easier to develop, manage, and distribute work. Its also easier to switch around things in an integrated software system by using a lot of cut and paste, since there are fewer dependencies to deal with.
