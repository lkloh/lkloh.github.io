Summarized from [here](https://hackernoon.com/ux-design-for-developers-d3429200a1da).

## User goals

What the user wants to achieve.
For example, an Uber rider wants to get from point A to point B.
It's usually best to break user goals into a list of tasks that must happen for the user to achieve their goal.

### Task List

List of tasks that must be accomplished for the user goal to be achieved.

### Example task list for Uber

1. Open Uber app
2. Enter destination
3. Choose the type of car to pick you
4. Confirm payment method
5. Confirm ride
6. Confirm pickup spot
7. Wait for car
8. Take the ride
9. Get out at destination
10. Review the ride

Task lists need careful design - Uber deliberately requires
uses to execute "6. Confirm pickup spot", though they could be reasonably
confident that the GPS could pinpoint the user accurately.

Some tasks must be done in a certain order (e.g. "Enter destination" before "Take the ride"),
but some could be done in any order (e.g. "Confirm ride" and "Confirm payment method").

### User Flow Diagrams

A task list can be transformed to a user flow diagram to show a user's path through an app.
User flow diagrams can be used to decide how the app should work before prototyping.


## Empathy map

Used to show how users think and feel about the experience of using a product,
and to collect data about individual users.
The data can then be used to look for patterns.

```
Example empathy map for a single user
=====================================
        |
Seeing  | Thinking & Feeling
        |
----------------------------
        |
Hearing | Saying
        |

User
Name: Charlie
Background: Non-technical, Consumer
```

## User Journey Map

Shows how a user is thinking and feeling about different points in time when using a product.
Combination of Task List and Empathy Map.

Types:
* Retrospective: How users do things based on your research
* Prospective: How you expect users to use a new product being developed


## User Personas

Describes goals, expectations, motivations, behavior of real people.

Example: Jane is a product manager who visits our site on weekdays at least 5 times a day,
but are pressed for time and rarely spend more than 15 minutes on our site.
She is profilic on social media, mostly Twitter and Instagram,
and her public image is important.

### Designing personas

* Think of ideal users
* When designing features, think of your ideal user, not the current users,
  so you can nudge them towards ideal behavior
* Several different user personas are needed as your users are different


## Takeway

Think of your users at every step in product design,
as your success depends on them.
