This blog will primarily be technical, but I'll sometime post
on other topics as well.

If you're a female in San Francisco looking for a place to live,
consider being my roommate!

I'm moving to a 2 bedroom apartment in [Potrero 1010](http://www.equityapartments.com/san-francisco/potrero-hill/potrero-1010-apartments) 
with a [friend](http://www.juliaguenther.co/#/) I knew from Stanford.
We were in the same freshman year dorm at 
[Lagunita Court](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/lagunita-court).
She works as a software engineer at Cisco; I work as a software engineer at Mixpanel.
So we will both be out of the house from at least 9am - 5pm on weekdays, likely longer. 

We're both quiet, clean, and respectful,
and hope to fine a like-minded person to take the converted living room.
We're asking $1450/month and will split the cost of utilities and wifi evenly.
Your one month deposit will be refunded on move out. 
Email me if that sounds like a fit! 
Our lease starts on August 1, 2017, so we're looking for someone ASAP.

The apartment itself is in an amazing location, in a residential district 
but with grocery stores, cafes, [boba tea shops](http://www.bobaguys.com/), 
and retailers within a walking distance. 
Its also close to SoMa and FiDi where many of the many tech companies are.
If you're not a fan of public transport you could bike there easily 
as the route to SoMa is mostly flat,
and there is space for bike storage in the garage of the building. 

If you are interested, email me at <lkloh2410@gmail.com> with a bit about yourself, a link
to your Facebook/LinkedIn profile, and we can talk!
