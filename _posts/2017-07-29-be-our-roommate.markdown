This blog will primarily be technical, but I'll sometime post
on other topics as well.
If you're a female in San Francisco looking for a place to live,
consider being my roommate!

I'm moving to a 2 bedroom apartment in [Potrero 1010](http://www.equityapartments.com/san-francisco/potrero-hill/potrero-1010-apartments) 
with a [friend](http://www.juliaguenther.co/#/) I knew from Stanford.
We were in the same freshman year dorm at 
[Lagunita Court](https://rde.stanford.edu/studenthousing/lagunita-court).
She works as a software engineer at Cisco; I work as a software engineer at Mixpanel.
So we will both be out of the house from 9am - 5pm on weekdays, most likely longer
due to the commute time. 

We're both quiet, clean, and respectful,
and hope to fine a like-minded person to take the converted living room.
We're asking $1450/month and will split the cost of utilities and wifi evenly.
We'll ask for a one month deposit that will be refunded on move out. 
Email me if that sounds like a fit. 

The apartment itself is amazing, in a residential district 
but with grocery stores, cafes, and retailers within a walking distance. 
Its also close to SoMa and FiDi where many of the many tech companies are.
Its an easy commute there, next to many buslines, 
though you could also bike as the route to SoMa is mostly flat.
There is space for bike storage in the garage of the building.
