Summary of _Rastogi, Ayushi, Suresh Thummalapenta, Thomas Zimmermann, Nachiappan Nagappan, and Jacek Czerwonka. "Ramp-up Journey of New Hires."_

## College graduates with engineering degrees take a few weeks to be productive

Those with internship experience became productive more quickly, obviously.

## How "productivity" is measured

Using Code check-ins to the master branch
* In particular, the amount of time to the first check-in
* Frequency of checkins - 
  indicates familiarity with process followed by the team
* Lines of code changes - 
  Indicator of effort spent
* Number of files changed - 
  Measures breath of knowledge of project

Hopefully these measurements correlate with degree of proficiency
around the product and code base.

## Proximity to the core team is correlated with quicker first code check-in

By "core team", they mean new hires working in the main headquarters,
versus those in other satellite offices worldwide 
(study done at Microsoft).

## Prior internships result in quicker ramp up time

But this is hardly a surprising finding,
except to validate that the investment in an internship programme 
for companies than can afford it is probably worthwhile.
