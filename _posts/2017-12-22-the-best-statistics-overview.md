Someone told me about this amazing [introduction to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50). Explains the concepts in a very intuitive manner instead of getting too lost in the details. My New Year's Resolution is to start writing an article a week with this amount of intuition, even for difficult concepts that involve a lot of math. If you can't explain something simple, you don't understand it.
