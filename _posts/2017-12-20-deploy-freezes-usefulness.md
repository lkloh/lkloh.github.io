Deploy freezes 
[This article](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/11/29/code-freezes-dont-prevent-outages/) 
argues that deploy freezes are bad because
* Stuff will still break anyway
* Lost productivity as people can't deploy stuff. Once they get back to work,
there are more dependencies because everyone is deploying stuff at the same time,
and people have to rebase on top of each others code - and that takes time
because something is going to be a breaking change.
If the end, less work got done due to the freeze, which did not even
help prevent the code from breaking because your users will still be
using your app while the freeze is in place.
