Amazon is looking for a location for its second new headquarters, and the New York Times just explained why it believes that the [headquarters will be in Denver, CO](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html). It wants to add 50 000 high paying white collar workers to the workforce in its second headquarters.

Whole Foods, which Amazon bought earlier this year, just opened an [shiny new store in downtown Denver](https://www.yelp.com/biz/whole-foods-market-denver-12), complete with an amazing food bar with all sorts of varieties of food. So convenient for office workers to pick up lunch.

Hmmmm, if you have the money, perhaps now is the time to buy some rental properties in Denver before the prices start shooting through the roof.
