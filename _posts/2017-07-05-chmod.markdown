`chmod` on files should be used sparingly,
even if it's more convenient to give everyone access to the files.

Causes lots of issues with security 
(anyone with user access can read and execute files),
and its hard to recover the system when something goes wrong.

Example [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/43621/what-if-i-accidentally-run-command-chmod-r-on-system-directories-etc):
someone ran `sudo chmod 755 -R /` and started getting permissions issues on everything.
He basically had to reinstall the system,
because resetting all permissions back to exactly what they were like before
(and allowing too many privileges somewhere) is too hard to be worth it.
