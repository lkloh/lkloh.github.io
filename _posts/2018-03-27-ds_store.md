title: "What happens if you delete then .DS_Store file?"

Nothing bad. It's used by MacOS systems to store the configuration settings of the finder.
If you delete the file, things like customized sizing of how the folders appear visually would 
disappear and resume the default.
Other than that, feel free to remove .DS_Store whenever you like,
or at least put it in the .gitignore file.

See [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69467/consequences-of-deleting-ds-store) for 
more info.
