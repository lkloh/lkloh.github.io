Which should you use? Both [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/)
seem to have very similar functions.
Underscore has been around longer than Lodash,
meaning it is probably entwined in many code repos. 

[According to the creater of Lodash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13789618/differences-between-lodash-and-underscore#), Lodash provides more coinsistent iteration support across different environments,
and its featureset is a superset of Underscore's, so you should try to use Lodash when possible,
or even swap it out with Underscore when you touch some code that uses Underscore.
