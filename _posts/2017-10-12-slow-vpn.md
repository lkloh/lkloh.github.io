## [What a VPN is for](https://www.whatismyip.com/what-is-a-vpn/)

* Corporations: add security to their networks in order to protect company data.
* To protect privacy on the internet
* To access sites that are limited in certain countries

## How it provides privacy

User's initial IP address is replaced with the one from the VPN provider.
Example: If you live in San Francisco and use a VPN, you can pretend you are from New York.

## How it works

* Encrypt all online data transfers
* Integrity checks to make sure the connection is not hijacked and no data is lost

## Why it [slows down your internet connection speed](https://www.cactusvpn.com/vpn/vpn-slow-down-internet/)

* Physical distance between your location and distance to the VPN server. Data packets need to travel back and forth over the VPN. Example: Connecting from China -> Mountain View takes a long time. Connecting from San Francisco -> Mountain View is fast. 
* Server load: too many user connecting to a VPN servers at once. Problematic with free VPN providers.
* Secure encryption protocol: The high the level of encryption, the slower the VPN speed.
* ISP speed limitation: High speed connections are fine as they allow > 10MB/s, but 3G or dial-up connections might limit the speed of the VPN.
* Processor speed of your laptop: Encrypt/decrypt data more quickly
* Reliability of VPN server: how much packet loss is there?
