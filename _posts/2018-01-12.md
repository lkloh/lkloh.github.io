When reviewing pull requests in Github, to reference a particular code block,
you can use [embedded code snippets](https://github.com/blog/2415-introducing-embedded-code-snippets)
to ensure all the information needed can be directly shown on a comment. 

One of the features they introduced recently, on August 15 last year, but so useful.
Somehow I missed the update - maybe they sent out an email that I didn't get
since I unsuscribe from all but comments on work that is directly relevant to me.
