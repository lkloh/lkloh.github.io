Jenkins is an automation serve that supports building, testing,
deploying for most projects. 
It can be used just to run tests on a project,
or also to deploy it.

The main product is [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/).
which automatically delivers software to users as it is being developed. 
The pipeline is written in a `Jenkinsfile` in the source code's repo.

There are several possibilities to use in Pipeline to deploy code,
but Docker images is the most common,
as they allow the environment and dependencies to be automatically deployed.
