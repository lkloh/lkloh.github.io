Modified from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12169822/backbone-js-id-vs-idattribute-vs-cid).

## Similarities

The `cid` and `id` are both unique identifiers for a model.

## Differences

* `cid` is assigned by backbone.js on the client side.
  Used when the model has not been saved to the server yet/
  will not be saved to the server because you're usingcookies.
* `id` assigned from the server (what it is in the db).
