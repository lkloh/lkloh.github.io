They don't make them like theY used to... 

Or so grandpa complains.

Maybe he's just being a grumpy old man.
Or maybe he's right.

My grandparents have a fan they bought when my mother was 6 years old.
First they used it at home,
then my aunt brough it to college for 4 years,
and returned it when she was done.
It's been sitting in his shop ever since,
and he's presumably turned it on whenever he was at work.
I'm not sure of he's exact hows, but let's assume he
turned it on for at least 40 hours a well.

They've had it for over 50 years now
and it's still going strong.
Sure he has to wipe it down and oil it every few years,
but that's all the maintainence he's had to do in over _half a century_!

Of course, new fans break down a lot faster. 
You'll be lucky if they last 5 years.
They're made to break down after a set period on purpose
so that manufacturers can turn a profit.
If everything they made lasted 50 years,
they'll be bankrupt very soon.

And not just fans, of course.
All other electronic equipment.
My mother's kettle, bought before she married my father,
lasted through 20 years of daily usage.
My electric water boiler barely lasted me through college.  

When such things break down, they tend to end up in a landfill.
And they typically aren't biogradable.
Imagine this compounded by every person/household.
Now you know why everyone's carbon footprint is getting larger and larger.
