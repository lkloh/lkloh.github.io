Summarized from "A Survey of Text Mining Techniques and Applications".

## What text mining is

Automated extraction of new information from different written resources.

It links together extracted information to form new facts or hypotheses
that can be explored further by more conventional means.

A variation of data mining - looking for interesting patterns from large databases.
Most information (>80%) is stored as text, thus it has high potential commercial value.
Unstructued texts are some of the largest easily available sources of knowledge.

## Text mining vs web search

* Search: User looks for something already known, that someone else wrote
* Text mining: User looks for unknown information, that no-one wrote down (since its unknown)
