jQuery was [build to make it easier to use JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp).
But now the trend seems to be to migrate away from it,
as there are now more tools to do the things jQuery was supposed to be used for.
See [here](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) for some of them.
So try to avoid using jQuery in new projects, 
to avoid having an additional dependency that needs to be updated,
and extra code in general.
