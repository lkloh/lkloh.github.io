[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a visual block based programming 
programming language developed at MIT to help children (or beginner programmers) learn to program
in an environment that is not as intimidating as a command line.
You can essentially create videos and animations with scratch by dragging UI elements
onto a storyboard and adding animations like in a powerpoint slide.
So not too much typing code, but more point and click style.
The UI of Scratch is designed to show the user how their work
is interpreted by the computer by having a "command palette"
visible that shows how the user's input is translated into instructions
that run things behind the scenes.
There's also a large online community to share and discuss with.
