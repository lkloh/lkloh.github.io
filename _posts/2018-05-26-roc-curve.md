## What it used to be

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC).
Originated from sonar in the 1940s.
Used to measure how well a sonar signal could be detected from noise.

## What it is now

Used to see how a predictive model can distinguish between true positives and negatives,
i.e. how whether the model correctly predicts a positive as positive and negative as negative.

## How it measures a model's performance

Plot sensitivity `P(truePositive / truePositive + falseNegative)`
agains 1-sensitivity `P(falsePositive / trueNegative + falsePositive)`.

Good rules are high on sensitivity and low on 1-specificity,
so most true positives are predicted to be positive,
and few true negatives are predicted to be positive.

## Types of models that are evaluated with an ROC curve

Usually but not always logistic regression.

In medical studies it is common to use an ROC to see how much better a biomarker
can predict disease status compared to chance.
