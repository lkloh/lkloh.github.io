ArXIV lets researchers post their papers without peer review.
It can be good because peer reviewers often take a long time.
Or it can be bad because some people take ArXIV papers
seriously, especially when the paper is [posted by someone with a big name](https://medium.com/@yoav.goldberg/an-adversarial-review-of-adversarial-generation-of-natural-language-409ac3378bd7).
And the paper turns out to be bad.
It still gets citations and people build on unstable sand.
