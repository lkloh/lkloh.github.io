[This article](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/08/to-kill-a-feature/)
describes how to take away an existing feature,
but users usually get really mad when you take away something that used to be there.
Actually, that applies to humans in general 
- they get angrier at something vanishing, 
than not having it in the first place.

## Reasons why unpopular features exist

* Built because they were easy to slip in
* Due to a competitor building it
* Specific customer requests
* It seemed like a good idea 5 years ago
* Useful for a sales pitch

## Reasons to kill a feature

* Few people use it
* Adds to complexity of the product
* Not your product's main focus (you should do one thing really well, not everything)
* Competing for attention with another feature
* Difficult to maintain

## Deciding whether to kill a feature

* Usage data - how many external users use that feature?
* Effort to maintain

## Things to be check when killing a feature

* Broken links from help docs
* Tracking codes depending on the now defunct pages
* Old screenshots on help docs/ marketing pages
* Communicate to marketing and sales people

## Telling your users a feature will be deprecated

* Turn it off immediately - only for features that are a fraction of your activity
* Beta removal - turn off for 10% of users and monitor the feedback. If no 
  one complains after a couple months, remove it
