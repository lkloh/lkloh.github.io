title:  "Browsers supporting ES6"

ES6 introduces lots of featurs to make JavaScript more reliable and efficient,
but it's not backwards compatible with ES5.

The latest Chrome, Firefore, Safari and Microsoft Edge now support ES6. 

Problem is that not everyone uses those browsers,
and not everyone upgrades their browsers. 
Lots of people use old devices that may make upgrading a browser problematic.
Think someone who has a 5 year old device.
The new browser versions probably would run really slowly
on the old hardware, or even not at all.
So they can't upgrade the browser even if they wanted to.
You have to think about those users as well.

What should a developer do? One of these:
* Continue developing using ONLY ES5
* Write code in ES6 and transpile toe ES5 before deployment. 

This is really important if you have a large user base.
You're a mature adult who needs to be considerate of others.

If you work at a small startup that just got off the ground in 2017..
well maybe don't worry yet, just develop on ES6.
Its where all the cool kids are now.
