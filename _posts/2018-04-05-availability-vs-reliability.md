# Definitions

[From here](https://simplicable.com/new/availability-vs-reliability).

## Availability

Percentage of time something is operational under normal systems.

A plane flown for many hours a month without much downtime
has high operational _availability_.

## Reliability

How well something endures real world conditions.

Example scenarios
* An airplan making it throuch multiple hazardous weather conditions is more
  _reliable_ than one that can make it through normal conditions
  but would fall apart when flying through volcanic ash.
