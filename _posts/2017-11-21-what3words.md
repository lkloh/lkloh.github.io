The [most novel idea](https://what3words.com/about/) in tech I've seen for a while: 
Mapping every `3m x 3m` of the earth to a unique phrase of three words.

Solves the problem of "I'm at 101 Main Street, but not sure where exactly you are".

Only problem is that you may want unique addresses for high rise buildings,
and an earthquake could alter physical geography significantly.
Have to be vigilant about that.
Very cool idea though.
