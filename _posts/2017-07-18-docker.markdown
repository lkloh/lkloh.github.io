[Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) 
calls itself a containers as a service platform.
The point of having Docker is to avoid software dependency hell
when there are lots of people with different machines
who are working on the same codebase.

Instead, the sysadmin can package the software needed to develop the code
such that if can run isolated.
This may make you think of VMs,
but a VM is essentially an entire operating system
running on top of another.
A container is not the entire operating system,
but only the minimum needed to get code to run.

So essentially,
docker saves devs from setting up a new environment
everytime a new hire comes in/ 
someone accidentally installed a virus on their laptop.

You could say that Docker allows for many stripped-down VMs
to be run on a shared operating system.

has a nice summary.
