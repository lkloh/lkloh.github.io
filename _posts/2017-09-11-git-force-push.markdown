title:  "Git force push forces comments to disappear"

I've used `git --force push` to forcefully push commits to master
after rebasing with other people's changes.
Unfortunately this tends to make earlier comments disappear.
There are certainly [ways to recover it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3973994/how-can-i-recover-from-an-erronous-git-push-f-origin-master),
but its really troublesome to have to dig into it.
I think I'll stick with saving comments I may want to go back and take a look by
taking a screenshot instead.
