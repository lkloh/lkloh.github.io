I went on a volunteer trip with my high school to teach
English to elementary school students in a remote location in China for 10 days.
I don't think I (or any of my other classmates who came on the trip)
managed to teach them any English, 
but we did have lots of fun playing with the local students.
They cried non-stop when we left.

Lots of college and employers value people who have done volunteer work,
but the type of volunteer work they value should probably be scrutinized more.
[This article](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22294205) 
highlights some of the negative effects of overseas volunteers, such as:

* Volunteers, especially young ones (like we were), don't have the skills to
do a good job. Would you be happy if a 16 year old high school student was your child/niece/nephew's
English teacher at their local elementary high school? Yeah, thought not.
* The children you are trying to help see you once for a few days, get attached,
and never see you again. The instability hurts them a lot more than the
few days of joy helps. Especially since lots of volunteers from wealthier
places like to come and help out - once.
* Real change needs time. Helping out for 10 days does almost nothing.
The people who primarily benefitted from the trip was for my fellow classmates and I,
not the local students.
* The trip cost quite a bit of money, about $1000 from my parents for the plane ticket,
and at least $1000 more from government subsidies. 
There were at least 15 of us on the trip so thats $30000 for a trip
that did very little good (or maybe even harm)
to the people who we said was out objective to help.
The $30000 could most likely have been put to better use - in our own country,
or by donating it to professionals at a non-profit who actually knew what they were doing. 

Even when you're an adult, there's probably no point volunteering
unless you really have specialised skills and can make a real committment.
Otherwise you'll probably make a greater positive impact by
taking a frequent vacations in poorer nations
and spending your money supporting local businesses there.
