[Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) let you share you work on Github
by allowing the code to be embedded in a webpage.
They are essentially a normal Github repository, but 
most notably allows you to share part of a file.
So if you have some code in a larger file that you want to share with someone for context,
gists are a good way to share them with outs by highlighting only the relevant parts. 
Or if you only have one file to share, making a repo for it may be overkill,
so that is when gists come in handy.
