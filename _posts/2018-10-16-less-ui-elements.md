There are lots of good reasons to keep your UI simple,
[one of which](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/simplicity-in-design-4-ways-to-achieve-simplicity-in-your-designs) is to make the purpose of your product obvious.
By making it obvious, there is less barrier to entry for new users,
who are most likely to discontinue usage if they encounter problems.

As a start, if there is an element you need to disable under certain conditions,
consider _removing_ it from the UI and bringing it back after the condition is no longer true,
perhaps with an explanatory tooltip about what occurred.
