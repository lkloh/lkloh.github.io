The [ECMA TC39](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) committee
is responsible for evolving the ECMAScript programming languages.
It operates using a democratic process.

To change the ECMA language, you need to follow a process in five stages to add a new feature.

## Stages to add a new feature

0. Strawman: allow input to specification
1. Proposal: Explain why the new feature is needed and describle a possible implementation
2. Draft: Specify the syntax and semantics
3. Candidate: Beta version, to be refined based on user feedback
4. Finished: Live on production

If you even thought multiline ternaries were confusing,
vote for [do expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-do-expressions)
to be approved.
