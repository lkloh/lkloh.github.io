title: "Raising Prices"

This [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/297773) explains why
raising your prices would bring in more profits,
and why offering 'discounts' doesn't work so well to raise your overall profits.

People value what they pay for. The more they pay, the more they value something.
It's probably why the graduation rate at Harvard is almost at 100%,
while the graduation rate for free MOOCs online that anyone with an Internet connection
can view is about 5%. 
It's because Harvard costs a lot of money for those paying the full ride,
and those that qualify for financial aid worked their tail off to be awarded a scholarship.
While just _anyone_ can enroll in an MOOC.
People value what they worked for/ paid for, not things they can get without any effort.

Also, higher prices attract better customers,
not customers looking to squeeze you for a buck,
who will complain about anything at the drop of a hat.
You'll also have more leeway to provide more and better services for the customers
that can pay your prices, so they get the most leverage out of your product.

Takeaways: Don't offer a product for free or less that it's fair market value.
If it's valuable, they will pay. If they won't, it probably means
the product needs a little refinement to fit the market's demands better.
