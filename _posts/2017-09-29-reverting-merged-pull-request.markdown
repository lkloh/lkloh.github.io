Github allows you to [revert a merged pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/reverting-a-pull-request/) starting c.2014. Useful when working on large collaborative projects and you need to quickly undo something that went wrong after merging. 

* Go to the pull request on the Github website
* Hit `revert`
* Get a new pull request to undo the stuff you merged previously
