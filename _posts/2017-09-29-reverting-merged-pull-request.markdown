Github allows you to 
[revert a merged pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/reverting-a-pull-request/) 
starting c.2014.
Useful when working on large projects with lots of people,
and you want to quickly undo something you merged if stuff goes wrong.

* Go to the pull request on the Github website
* Hit revert
* Get a new pull request to undo the stuff you merged previously, but don't want
