## Introduction

Publish/Subscribe "Pub/Sub" messaging - 
asynchronous service-to-service communication used in microservices architectures.

Any message published to a topic is received immediately by all subscribers to the topic.
Used to enable event-driven architectures (something happens immediately after a
message is published), or decouple applications.

## How Pub/Sub messaging is different from a Message Queue

Message processing timing
* _Pub/Sub_: Provide instant event notifications for distributed applications (no queuing)
* _Message Queue_: Batches messages until the can be retrieved

Information the component sending the message has
* _Pub/Sub_: Does not need to know who the subscribers (components receiving the message) are
* _Message Queue_: Uusally knows which component(s) it is sending messages to

## Subscribers to a message topic

The subscribers to a topic all receive the message the moment it is published.
They can each do something different with the message.
