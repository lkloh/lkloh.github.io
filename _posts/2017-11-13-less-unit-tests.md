Projects have datelines.
There aren't many front-end tests written in a repository that
has had hundreds of of contributors working on it over the years...
what do you do?

If you don't write tests now while developing a new feature, 
you're never go back and add it.
And if you're a front-end developer, if anything you write breaks,
chances are it's really obvious what went wrong.

Here's an article to make you feel better about [not writing unit tests](https://medium.com/pacroy/why-most-unit-testing-is-waste-tests-dont-improve-quality-developers-do-47a8584f79ab).
It argues that writing extra tests leads to more maintainence nightmares,
and tricks you into thinking your work is well done.
Plus, there is not substitute for good code design.
