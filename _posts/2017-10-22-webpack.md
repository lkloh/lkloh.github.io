"Webpack" gets thrown around a lot when doing front end development.

## What it does

Combines multiple files and assets into one big file

```
.js   .less                        .js  .css
.css  .sass ======> Webpack =====>  
.png. .ts                          .jpg .png

## Why did someone(s) come up with it?

* Webapps today are dynamically generated by JavaScript in the browser.
* During development, an app has lots of JavaScript files
with different dependencies that can cause dependency hell.

## How webpack helps avoid dependency hell

* Makes a graph of dependencies of the front-end assets.
* Loads the required modules in the correct order asynchronously/in parallel 

## Why was webpack developed only recently, not 20 years ago?

Pages sent to a browser used to be mainly static html files,
back when things were less fancy.
